- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India: Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX, cleared its final regulatory hurdle in India, allowing it to start commercial operations after a three-year process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, enabling Indian consumers to purchase electric cars for the first time. Experts noted that these developments signify progress in Elon Musk's efforts to enter the Indian market despite challenges like high import duties. Starlink must comply with India's data localization requirements and set up physical sites for connectivity. The high price of Tesla vehicles in India, due to import duties and taxes, may limit sales and infrastructure development.
