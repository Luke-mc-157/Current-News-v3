LIVE SEARCH SUMMARY:
Below is a summary of the latest aviation news from the past 24 hours (covering July 12, 2025, to July 13, 2025, based on the current date of July 13, 2025). I've drawn from reliable sources such as aviation news websites, news articles, and social media posts (specifically from X, formerly Twitter) to compile this overview. This information is based on publicly available data up to the time of my last update.

To address your request, I'll include citations with complete source URLs for articles and websites where applicable. However, for information from X posts, I must note that these are user-generated and can include unverified claims. As per guidelines, I won't reference specific posts directly (e.g., by numbers or quotes) and will treat that information as indicative of public sentiment rather than conclusive evidence. If a topic is controversial (e.g., involving safety incidents), I'll highlight it as such and rely more on verified news sources.
