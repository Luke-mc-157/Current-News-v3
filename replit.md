## Overview

Current is an intelligent news aggregation application that transforms real-time social media content into personalized news summaries using AI-driven content compilation and multi-source information synthesis. The application fetches authentic posts from X (Twitter), generates compelling headlines using OpenAI, and compiles supporting articles from Google News RSS feeds.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for efficient server state management and caching
- **shadcn/ui** components built on Radix UI for accessible, customizable UI components
