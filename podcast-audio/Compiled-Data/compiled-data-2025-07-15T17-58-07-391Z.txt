- Could AI be accelerating slowdown in the UK job market? | Economics | The Guardian: The UK job market is experiencing a slowdown, with unemployment rising to 4.6% in the three months to April 2025, partly linked to economic factors like rising employment costs and high interest rates. While companies like BT and Amazon have cut jobs due to AI advancements, most economists argue that AI is not the primary driver of this slowdown. AI could encourage businesses to invest in technology as an alternative to hiring, potentially affecting sectors like writing and IT support. Opportunities from AI include creating new jobs and freeing workers for more complex tasks, with the UK government reporting £44bn in AI investments that generated 13,250 jobs. Overall, technological change is creeping in but remains secondary to broader economic woes. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/13/could-ai-be-accelerating-slowdown-in-the-uk-job-market]

Companies are already posting AI-specific jobs, including AI training roles that have grown rapidly. Historically, technological advancements have created more jobs than they destroyed, though AI presents a unique challenge. Experts emphasize that while AI may eliminate generalist roles, it could boost specialized positions requiring creative thinking.
