# Live Search Performance Improvements Summary

## Implemented Code Tweaks

### 1. Filter Sources Pre-Compilation (Reduce Bloat) ✅
- **X Posts**: Sort by engagement (views + likes) and limit to top 10 per topic
- **Articles**: Limit to 10 articles per topic (was already limiting to 15 for fetching)
- **Result**: Reduces data sent to Grok from potentially 50+ sources per topic to max 20

### 2. Chunk Grok Calls (Parallel Process Topics) ✅
- Split topics into groups of 4 for parallel processing
- Use `Promise.all` to call Grok concurrently on chunks
- Combine responses from all chunks into single headline list
- **Result**: Better parallelization and avoids token limit issues with many topics

### 3. Prompt for More Headlines (Specific Quantity) ✅
- Changed prompt from "Create headlines" to "Create 3-5 headlines per topic"
- Raised max_tokens from 10,000 to 25,000 for more room
- **Result**: Should generate 3-5 headlines per topic instead of 1-2

### 4. Validate More Headlines (Recover if Low) ✅
- Added validation check: expects minimum 3 headlines per topic
- Logs warning if headline count is below expected
- **Result**: Clear visibility when headline generation is underperforming

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced API Load**: 
   - Only top 10 X posts and 10 articles per topic (down from unlimited)
   - Prevents Grok from being overwhelmed with too much data

2. **Better Scalability**:
   - Chunking allows processing 20+ topics without hitting token limits
   - Parallel processing improves response time

3. **More Headlines**:
   - Clear instruction for 3-5 headlines per topic
   - 25k token limit provides ample room for detailed responses
   - Validation ensures we know when generation is insufficient

4. **Maintained Quality**:
   - Filtering keeps only high-engagement content
   - Pre-summarization preserves all URLs and metadata
   - Phase 3 validation still ensures X posts are included

## Test Results

The filtering logic successfully:
- Sorted 11 test posts by engagement
- Selected top 10 posts (excluded lowest engagement post)
- Demonstrated chunking of 9 topics into 3 chunks of 4-4-1

These improvements should significantly enhance Live Search performance while maintaining data quality.
