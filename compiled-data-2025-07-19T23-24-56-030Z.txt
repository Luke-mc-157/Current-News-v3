- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India - The New York Times: Elon Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX, achieved significant milestones in India with Starlink gaining final regulatory approval for commercial operations and Tesla opening its first showroom in Mumbai. This development followed years of efforts to enter the Indian market, despite challenges like high import duties and data localization requirements. Experts noted that Starlink could target semi-urban areas for better internet access, while Tesla's vehicles face premium pricing that may limit widespread adoption. The showroom opening is seen as symbolically important but commercially limited due to costs, with potential future tariff reductions possibly boosting sales. Additionally, the relationship between Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains complex amid business disputes. Overall, these inroads represent progress in expanding Musk's ventures in India. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/world/asia/tesla-starlink-india-elon-musk.html]
