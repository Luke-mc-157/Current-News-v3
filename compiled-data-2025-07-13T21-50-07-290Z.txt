AAIB’s preliminary report disclosed the crucial dialogues exchanged by the pilots just before the crash. Report outlines a harrowing sequence of events that unfolded within 90 seconds of the take-off. Both engines shut down unexpectedly during initial climb, leading to catastrophic loss of thrust and rapid descent, report said. Pilots’ conversation was recorded in the aircraft's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder during the crash. “Why did you cut off?”, one pilot was heard asking the other, to which the response was, "I did not". Commercial Pilot Rajiv Pratap Rudy on July 12 briefed about AAIB report on Ahmedabad Plane crash. “AAIB report states that aircraft took flight normally, meaning it was capable of getting airborne. The jet fuel switch was in its required position. Later, the pilots reported engine power decreasing. Further probe will bring out why the engines had 'flame out'. Captain Sabharwal and his co-pilot, using their years of experience, tried to relight the engines...How and why this happened will be known through further investigation...,” said Rajiv Pratap Rudy.
