FULL CONTENT (15106 chars): Bitcoin rompe US$ 120 mil e mira nova máxima em US$ 130 mil Ecosistema Español Noticias Mercados Personalidades Aprenda Cassio Gusson hace 14 horas Precio de Bitcoin hoy 14/07/2025: BTC subió un 3%, llegó a 123.000 dólares con los alcistas venciendo a los bajistas La criptomoneda subió al inicio de la semana y alcanza un nuevo récord por encima de 123.000 dólares, impulsada por la demanda institucional y un escenario global inestable. Análisis de Precios El precio de Bitcoin ( BTC ), en la mañana de este lunes, está cotizado en 121.568,43 dólares. Los alcistas aplastaron a los bajistas y elevaron el precio de BTC en más de un 4%, registrando un nuevo máximo histórico para el activo con su valor por encima de 123.000 dólares. Análisis macroeconómico de Bitcoin André Franco, CEO de Boost Research, señala que los mercados globales iniciaron la semana con una leve caída después de que el presidente Trump anunciara aranceles del 30% sobre las importaciones de la Unión Europea y México, con vigencia prevista para el 1º de agosto, ampliando la aversión al riesgo. Los futuros de los principales índices americanos retrocedieron, mientras que el dólar se fortaleció frente al euro, el yen y el peso. Incluso con el tenso escenario comercial, Bitcoin se disparó, alcanzando un nuevo récord de 122.360 dólares, impulsado por fuertes entradas institucionales en ETFs y por el creciente optimismo regulatorio con la aproximación de la “Crypto Week” en el Congreso americano. La expectativa a corto plazo es positiva, con el inicio de la Crypto Week entre los días 14 y 18. Los resultados que deben ser favorables al sector deben dictar el tono del mercado, junto con posibles nuevos anuncios de aranceles. Mercado Bitcoin destacó que la subida está ligada al modo en que Bitcoin se está convirtiendo en una reserva de valor global, reconocida por gobiernos y empresas. “Bitcoin tiende a ganar espacio como protección contra políticas monetarias inestables y controles de capital, un movimiento que refuerza los fundamentos de Bitcoin. Además de ofrecer más protección contra los cambios del mercado, Bitcoin es el activo con mayor retorno de la última década, entre los activos digitales o tradicionales. Bitcoin con fuerza total De acuerdo con el analista de CryptoQuant, Axel Adler Jr, actualmente, observamos una actualización clásica de las Bandas de Bollinger: la amplitud entre los límites superior e inferior cayó al 7,7%, uno de los valores más bajos de todo el ciclo alcista. Según él, la disminución de la volatilidad indica acumulación de energía en el mercado, el precio está listo para una subida y, en un entorno de tendencia ascendente, las probabilidades de una ruptura ascendente son significativamente mayores. También destaca que la disminución de la volatilidad indica acumulación de energía en el mercado, el precio está listo para una subida y, en un entorno de tendencia alcista, las posibilidades de una ruptura son significativamente mayores. En este ciclo alcista, hubo seis episodios notables de estrechamiento de las Bandas de Bollinger. En cuatro de ellos, la compresión fue inmediatamente seguida de crecimiento, mientras que en dos casos hubo primero una leve corrección, tras la cual el crecimiento fue retomado.Con base en esta experiencia, la actual compresión anuncia muy probablemente otro impulso ascendente, aunque tampoco esté excluida una pequeña consolidación antes del movimiento.En cuatro de ellos, la especificación fue inmediatamente seguida de crecimiento, mientras que en dos casos ocurrió inicialmente una leve corrección, seguida de la retomada del crecimiento. Con base en esa experiencia, la especificación actual probablemente anuncia otro impulso alcista, aunque una pequeña afirmación antes del movimiento tampoco esté descartada. El mercado cripto inició la semana con fuerza total. Bitcoin rompió otra máximo histórico, al alcanzar 122.761 dólares, liderando una subida generalizada que elevó el valor total de las criptomonedas a 3,81 billones de dólares, un avance del 4% en las últimas 24 horas. Con BTC a la cabeza, Ethereum subió un 2,2% y alcanzó 3.041 dólares, mientras que Solana avanzó un 1,2%, cotizada en 165 dólares. El rally refuerza la dominancia de Bitcoin en este ciclo alcista y viene acompañado por fuertes entradas institucionales en ETFs, movimiento que continúa sosteniendo la tendencia alcista. Según datos del mercado, los fondos de Bitcoin registraron 1.030 millones de dólares en entradas solo en el último día, marcando el segundo día consecutivo por encima de la marca de 1.000 millones de dólares. Ethereum también atrajo 205 millones de dólares, mientras que Solana recibió 11 millones de dólares, consolidándose como una apuesta relevante para inversores con mayor apetito por riesgo. "La ola de capital institucional confirma la fuerza del momento, pero sabemos que este tipo de impulso puede revertir rápidamente cuando la presión compradora pierde fuelle", explicó Valentin Fournier, analista jefe de BRN. Él reforzó que el momento exige atención redoblada. "Estamos listos para reducir exposición en caso de que la actividad institucional desacelere", afirmó. Al mismo tiempo, grandes players siguen reforzando posiciones. MetaPlanet añadió 96 millones de dólares en Bitcoin a sus reservas. Strategy ya ha señalado una nueva compra tras una semana de pausa, indicando que el apetito por BTC aún está lejos de enfriarse. Aunque los criptoactivos están en alza, los analistas alertan sobre el riesgo de agotamiento del movimiento. El mercado ya opera en niveles que históricamente precedieron correcciones. “La volatilidad ofrecerá oportunidades reales de lucro, pero el inversor necesita saber proteger las ganancias tan pronto como el impulso se debilite”, destacó Fournier.En la asignación de activos de BRN, la exposición a Bitcoin permanece elevada: BTC: 68% – activo central de la estrategiaETH: 12% – ajustado tras la rupturaSOL: 5% – mantenida para capturar beta adicionalEfectivo: 15% – ampliado para gestionar ganancias y volatilidad Análisis técnico de Bitcoin Nic Puckrin, analista de criptomonedas, inversor y fundador de The Coin Bureau, afirma que, a diferencia de los máximos históricos anteriores, las tasas de financiación futuras aún están en niveles normales, lo que significa que el riesgo de liquidaciones en cascada es bajo. Además, las tasas de interés aún están altas y las impresoras de dinero ni siquiera han sido encendidas todavía. La volatilidad también permanece en mínimos históricos, con la volatilidad implícita, en algunos momentos, por debajo de la del S&amp;P 500. Según él, lo más importante es que los compradores minoristas aún no están a la vista. Esta subida aún es impulsada por el capital institucional, mientras que las señales típicas de participación minorista –aumento del tráfico de búsquedas y rankings de aplicaciones de criptomonedas– están ausentes. Y no los veo involucrándose de forma significativa hasta que lleguemos a cerca de 150.000 dólares y el miedo a quedarse fuera (FOMO) se instale. Dicho esto, la relación compra/venta de Bitcoin está actualmente desequilibrada a favor de los compradores, mientras que las liquidaciones en 24 horas están cerca de 1.000 millones de dólares, por lo que una reversión a corto plazo en el precio está casi garantizada, con liquidaciones acercándose a 118.000 dólares. Independientemente de dónde lleguemos antes de esa reversión, tendremos una semana emocionante en el mercado de criptomonedas. De esta forma, queda claro que la nueva arremetida ganó fuerza con el aumento de la demanda institucional en medio de la incertidumbre global, impulsando el precio de la mayor criptomoneda del mercado a niveles nunca vistos. “El principal motor de la aceleración fue la compra institucional, que se intensificó con el escenario internacional más inestable”, explicó Slobodan Drvenica, analista técnico sénior. Según él, la ruptura de hoy rompe la resistencia anterior en 123.023 dólares, una marca técnica relevante ligada a la proyección del 123,6% de Fibonacci de la subida que comenzó en 74.389 dólares. Con ello, el próximo objetivo psicológico son 130.000 dólares, seguido por la región de 131.331 dólares que representa la proyección del 161,8% del mismo movimiento. “La confirmación técnica vendrá con el cierre diario por encima de 120.000 dólares”, dijo Drvenica. “Ese nivel ahora actúa como el primer soporte, y cualquier retroceso más fuerte debe encontrar una base sólida por encima de la región de 117.000 dólares”, completó. Entre los principales niveles técnicos monitoreados por los analistas están: Resistencias: 123.260 dólares, 127.100 dólares, 130.000 dólares y 131.330 dólares Soportes: 122.000 dólares, 121.260 dólares, 120.000 dólares y 118.900 dólares Paulo Aragão, presentador y fundador del podcast Giro Bitcoin , destaca que la subida de BTC desafía el nivel de retroceso de Fibonacci del 61,8%, basado en la tendencia, en 121.357 dólares, trazado desde el mínimo del 7 de abril, de 74.508 dólares, hasta la máxima del 22 de mayo, de 111.980 dólares. Con Bitcoin entrando en modo de descubrimiento de precios, un cierre diario por encima de 121.357 dólares podría extender la tendencia alcista al nivel de Fibonacci del 78,6%, en 127.652 dólares. Por su parte, Mike Ermolaev, analista y fundador de Outset PR, señala que si la dominancia de Bitcoin rompe la resistencia y cierra por encima del 66% con fuerte impulso, esto puede señalar un cambio más profundo. Esta ruptura mostraría que Bitcoin no solo está liderando el mercado, sino que está empezando a tomar el control completamente. En ese caso, el valor de mercado de Bitcoin podría subir aún más rápido, restando valor a casi todas las categorías de altcoins. El gráfico de dominancia de BTC entraría en un nuevo territorio, rompiendo el canal ascendente que se mantiene desde hace casi dos años.Tal ruptura también puede significar que las altcoins enfrentarán más debilidad en el futuro. Los traders pueden seguir prefiriendo Bitcoin por su relativa seguridad, especialmente en condiciones de mercado inciertas. Por lo tanto, el precio de Bitcoin el 14 de julio de 2025 es de R$ 675.380,15 . A este valor, 180,00 dólares compran 0,0014 BTC y 0,18 dólares compran 0,0000014 BTC. Las criptomonedas con mayor subida el día 14 de julio de 2025 son : Algorand ( ALGO ), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) y Sui ( SUI ), con subidas del 17%, 13% y 15% respectivamente. Las criptomonedas que están registrando las mayores caídas el día 14 de julio de 2025 son: Dacxi (DXI), Bounce ( AUCTION ) y Hosico Cat (HOSICO), con caídas del -13%, -11% y -10% respectivamente. ¿Qué es Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) es una moneda digital que es usada y distribuida electrónicamente. Bitcoin es una red descentralizada peer-to-peer. Ninguna persona o institución lo controla. Bitcoin no puede ser impreso y su cantidad es muy limitada – solamente 21 millones de Bitcoin pueden ser creados. Bitcoin fue presentado por primera vez como un software de código abierto por un programador o un grupo de programadores anónimos bajo el nombre clave Satoshi Nakamoto, en 2009. Hubo muchos rumores sobre la identidad real del creador de BTC, sin embargo, todas las personas mencionadas en esos rumores negaron públicamente ser Nakamoto. El propio Nakamoto afirmó ser un hombre de 37 años que vive en Japón. Sin embargo, debido a su inglés perfecto y a que su software no fue desarrollado en japonés, hay dudas sobre esa información. Alrededor de mediados de 2010, Nakamoto se dedicó a otras cosas y dejó Bitcoin en manos de algunos miembros prominentes de la comunidad BTC. Para muchas personas, la principal ventaja de Bitcoin es su independencia de gobiernos mundiales, bancos y empresas. Ninguna autoridad puede interferir en las transacciones de BTC, imponer tasas de transacción o quitar dinero a las personas. Además, el movimiento de Bitcoin es extremadamente transparente: cada transacción única se almacena en un gran libro mayor público y distribuido, llamada la blockchain. Esencialmente, como Bitcoin no es controlado como una organización, les da a los usuarios control total sobre sus finanzas. La red Bitcoin comparte un libro mayor público llamado "cadena de bloques" (block - bloque, chain - cadena). Si alguien intenta cambiar solo una letra o número en un bloque de transacciones, también afectará a todos los bloques que vendrán a continuación. Debido a que es un libro público, un error o un intento de fraude pueden ser detectados y corregidos fácilmente por cualquier persona. La billetera del usuario puede verificar la validez de cada transacción. La firma de cada transacción está protegida por firmas digitales correspondientes a las direcciones de envío. Debido al proceso de verificación y, dependiendo de la plataforma de negociación, puede llevar algunos minutos para que una transacción de BTC sea completada. El protocolo de Bitcoin fue diseñado para que cada bloque tarde alrededor de 10 minutos en ser minado.

Foto: Clickout Media Die Zahlen am Kryptomarkt überschlagen sich. Der Bitcoin-Kurs hat noch in der letzten Woche mit 112.000 Dollar ein neues Allzeithoch erreicht und notiert heute schon deutlich höher. Auf unglaubliche 121.000 Dollar ist der Kurs der digitalen Leitwährung heute in den Morgenstunden gestiegen und startet damit bullish in die neue Woche. Inzwischen werden auch immer mehr Stimmen laut, dass der Markt überhitzt ist und es an der Zeit ist, zu shorten, also auf fallende Kurse zu setzen. Das könnte sich allerdings als Trugschluss erweisen. Trader sollten hier vorsichtig sein.&nbsp; 11 % in einer Woche&nbsp; Immer wieder hat man gehört, dass der Bitcoin-Kurs nach dem Erreichen der 100.000 Dollar Marke nicht mehr viel höher steigen kann. Tatsächlich hat sich die psychologisch wertvolle Marke als hartnäckiger Widerstand erwiesen. Im Bereich zwischen 108.000 und 112.000 Dollar wurde jeder Versuch der Bullen, auszubrechen, abgewürgt. Nun zeigt sich ein ganz anderes Bild. Der Widerstand ist längst überwunden und Bitcoin auf 121.000 Dollar gestiegen.&nbsp; Foto: Clickout Media (Bitcoin Chart – Quelle: Tradingview )&nbsp; Allein in der letzten Woche ist der Bitcoin-Kurs damit um mehr als 11 % gestiegen und damit scheint nun wieder alles möglich zu sein. Allerdings hat man schon beim Ausbruch in der letzten Woche immer wieder gehört, dass es ab dem Erreichen der 120.000 Dollar Marke auch genauso schnell wieder bergab gehen wird. Aber stimmt das wirklich?&nbsp; Experten anderer Meinung&nbsp; Natürlich ist nach so starken Kursrallyes immer wieder mal mit Korrekturen zu rechnen. Allerdings dürften diese bei Bitcoin nun nicht so heftig ausfallen, wie das viele vermuten. Einige erwarten sogar einen Kurs von weniger als 100.000 Dollar. Dabei deutet aktuell einiges darauf hin, dass es dazu nie mehr kommen könnte. Vielmehr zeigen Experten auf, warum Bitcoin noch viel Luft nach oben hat.&nbsp; Der Kurs ist zwar auf neue Höhen gestiegen, das Interesse der Anleger ist aber immer noch kaum vorhanden. Auch On-Chain-Daten zeigen, dass es nach wie vor in erster Linie Wale und institutionelle Investoren sind, die den Bitcoin-Kurs antreiben. Der Experte von Rundumbitcoin geht davon aus, dass ab einem gewissen Punkt aber der Moment erreicht ist, an dem bei Privatanlegern doch noch Fomo aufkommt und dadurch nochmal eine Menge frisches Kapital in den Markt strömt.&nbsp; Seiner Meinung nach könnte dieser Moment beispielsweise bei einem Kurs von 130.000 Dollar erreicht sein, da Anleger sich dann langsam aber sicher von der Vorstellung trennen dürften, dass der Kurs nicht mehr viel höher steigen kann. Bei 100.000 Dollar ist die psychologische Hürde groß, bei einem Kurs von 130.000 Dollar wird dagegen dann auch wieder ein Kursziel von 200.000 Dollar oder mehr vorstellbar. Damit stehen die Chancen gut, dass die Rallye auch hier noch lange nicht zu Ende ist. Eine Entwicklung, von der auch Altcoins wie Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) stark profitieren dürften.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jetzt mehr über Bitcoin Hyper erfahren. Bitcoin Hyper vor Mega-Rallye?&nbsp; Bitcoin gilt seit Jahren als digitales Gold und festigt diesen Ruf nun auch langsam an der Wall Street. Ein zuverlässiger Wertspeicher mit begrenztem Angebot. Doch während sich Ethereum und Solana längst als Plattformen für dezentrale Finanzanwendungen (DeFi) etabliert haben, blieb Bitcoin bislang außen vor, da der DeFi-Bereich erst mit neueren Blockchains ins Leben gerufen wurde.&nbsp; Das soll sich mit Bitcoin Hyper jetzt ändern. Das Projekt bringt eine eigene Layer-2-Blockchain, die auf Solana basiert, an den Start, über die Nutzer ihre BTC in den DeFi-Bereich bringen können. Geplant ist der Zugang zu Staking, Lending und Yield Farming, mit schnellen, günstigen Transaktionen und direkter Anbindung an das leistungsstarke Solana-Ökosystem. Foto: Clickout Media ($HYPER Token-Vorverkauf – Quelle: Bitcoin Hyper Website ) Der Ansatz trifft den Nerv der Zeit und kommt bei Anlegern an. Der zugehörige Token $HYPER befindet sich aktuell im Vorverkauf und hat bereits fast 2,7 Millionen Dollar umgesetzt, obwohl der Börsenstart erst bevorsteht. Ein früher Einstieg kann sich dabei gleich doppelt lohnen. Neben einem günstigen Einstiegskurs, der im Laufe des Presales mehrfach erhöht wird, ist auch das Staking bereits aktiviert. Dadurch erhalten Investoren zusätzliche Token als Belohnung. Vor allem jetzt zu Beginn, wo das Angebot noch knapp ist und die Renditen entsprechend hoch ausfallen. Aktuell liegt die Staking-Rendite noch bei 322 %.&nbsp; Durch das frühe Staking wird ein erheblicher Teil der Token direkt gebunden, was das verfügbare Angebot beim Launch stark reduziert. Das könnte sich als Katalysator für eine Kursexplosion erweisen. Kein Wunder, dass Analysten dem Projekt eine Milliardenbewertung zutrauen. Sollte sich Bitcoin Hyper als bevorzugte Lösung für Bitcoin-DeFi etablieren, könnte $HYPER zu den größten Gewinnern des aktuellen Zyklus gehören, wobei auch Renditen von x20 – x30 nicht ausgeschlossen sind.&nbsp; Jetzt rechtzeitig einsteigen und $HYPER im Presale kaufen.

All Posts by Luciano Rocha Analista de Criptomoedas Analista de Criptomoedas Last updated: 14th julio 2025 El tranquilo fin de semana del Bitcoin (BTC) no duró mucho, y la emoción llegó la noche del domingo. En pocas horas, la criptomoneda se valorizó un 3,6% y rompió con fuerza la barrera de los 120.000 USD. Según CoinGecko, el BTC alcanzó un máximo de 123.100 USD en la mañana del lunes 14. Además del aumento en el precio, el volumen de negociación se disparó y llegó a 55,4 mil millones de USD . La semana pasada, el precio de Bitcoin registró un importante aumento del 8,76%, el mejor resultado para el periodo en 2025. Muchas altcoins imitaron el desempeño espectacular de Bitcoin. En el Top 10, XRP se valorizó un 7,1% y destacó con un precio de 2,98 USD. Ethereum (ETH) aumentó un 3,4% y comenzó el día cotizando a 3.064 USD. BNB, que celebró su séptimo aniversario esta semana, superó los 700 USD tras un aumento del 2%. El valor total del mercado de criptomonedas ganó más de 100 mil millones de USD desde ayer y alcanza casi 3,9 billones de USD en CoinGecko. Por su parte, Bitcoin alcanzó los 2,41 billones de USD y superó a Amazon , convirtiéndose en el 5º activo más valioso del mundo, por detrás de Apple, con 3,1 billones de USD. En cuanto a monedas, el BTC superó al dólar de Taiwán y ahora es la 8ª moneda más valiosa del mundo . El dólar de Hong Kong está justo por delante, con un valor de mercado de 2,5 billones de USD. Lee también: China cambia de tono y podría abrir su mercado a las stablecoins Bitcoin alcanza un pico durante el fin de semana Hace menos de siete días, el principal activo digital se encontraba en un rango estrecho, con un límite superior de 110.000 USD . En pocos días, los traders lograron romper esa resistencia y causaron un aumento superior al 10% en el precio de la criptomoneda. El primer rompimiento ocurrió cuando los traders finalmente superaron esta resistencia y llevaron el activo hasta los 112.000 USD. Este era el primer nivel de resistencia, ya que correspondía al máximo histórico anterior de Bitcoin. Todo este movimiento ocurrió el viernes 11, por lo que el sábado 12 fue un día tranquilo, con poca o ninguna acción reportada. En este tiempo, Bitcoin se consolidaba por encima de la región de los 118.000 USD e intentaba superar los 119.000 USD en algunas ocasiones. Sin embargo, el escenario cambió más tarde en el día, cuando Bitcoin superó los 119.000 USD y estableció un nuevo récord. El lunes también comenzó con nuevos avances, y el último máximo histórico está por encima de los 123.000 USD (en Bitstamp). Esto significa que el BTC ha sumado aproximadamente 15.000 USD desde el pasado miércoles. Traders sufren pérdidas por liquidaciones Como resultado, los traders que apostaron a la baja del Bitcoin sufrieron grandes pérdidas. Según Coinglass , las liquidaciones en el mercado de derivados llegaron a 752 millones de USD. La mayoría (624 millones de USD) afectaron a las posiciones vendidas, de las cuales el BTC fue el principal responsable, con 476 millones de USD liquidados. «Mirando el panorama a corto plazo, la tendencia para el BTC es fuertemente alcista, impulsada por compras institucionales y un entorno macroeconómico favorable. Entre los posibles riesgos vemos un RSI muy elevado, lo que indica sobrecompra, lo que podría llevar a una corrección o consolidación», comentó Guilherme Prado, country manager de Bitget en Brasil. Si el precio pierde los 115.000 USD, Bitcoin podría probar los 110.500 USD y, en caso de mayor presión vendedora, los 107.000 USD.

The momentum has been largely driven by institutional inflows, led by BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which hit a record $83 billion in AUM—tripling within just 200 trading days, a feat that took the gold ETF (GLD) over 15 years. IBIT now holds over 700,000 BTC, outpacing its peers by nearly 100,000 BTC. Simultaneously, accumulation wallets—those with consistent BTC inflows and minimal outflows—have intensified their buying, signaling renewed confidence from long-term holders.&nbsp; At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $120,744. BTC, after taking support at the key level of $73,500, surged almost 50% to $111,980. Following this move, the asset entered a consolidation phase, trading within a range of $100,000 to $110,000 with low volumes. BTC eventually broke out above this range and rallied to $121,492, forming a ‘Higher High Higher Low’ pattern. The asset has strong support at $110,000 and $100,000.

Emergency crews resumed some recovery efforts Sunday afternoon after heavy rain brought renewed flood threats to Kerr County, temporarily halting operations in a region still reeling from the floods when the Guadalupe River burst its banks. At least 101 people are still missing as of Thursday, Governor Greg Abbott said. Abbott said Sunday that rescue operations were underway in San Saba – where more than nine inches of rain fell – as well as in Lampasas and Schleicher counties. Evacuations were ongoing across Central Texas, with authorities closely monitoring rising waters in Kerrville. Later Sunday, Abbott wrote on X that “dozens” of people had been rescued in the Lampasas area, after the Lampasas River surged by 23ft in under four hours. “Life-threatening” flash flooding began Monday morning in a vulnerable stretch of the Hill Country, as heavy rain and thunderstorms swept across Kerr, Bandera, Real, and Uvalde counties, the National Weather Service said. It comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's response to the deadly floods, asserting that her department acted swiftly and received commendation from state officials.

With the new addition of Burnet, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, and Tom Green counties, 10 counties are now approved for the FEMA Public Assistance program. “President Trump’s approval of my request to add more counties to his disaster declaration is another critical step to get Texans the support they need to recover,” Abbott said in a statement Monday. He added: “I thank President Trump for swiftly approving my request to approve these additional counties. Texas continues to work around-the-clock to help every impacted community heal and rebuild.” Rachel Dobkin 15 July 2025 01:33 Texas Governor expresses gratitude for support from other states Texas Governor Greg Abbott thanked the states that sent crews to assist with search and rescue efforts in central Texas. At least 25 states have sent assistance to Texas. “You can see one thing that's quite obvious, and that is doesn't matter if they're a red state or blue state, they're fellow Americans, and when times get tough, Americans come together,” he said. Katie Hawkinson 15 July 2025 00:30 Texas leads nation in flood deaths due to geography, size and population Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.

Katie Hawkinson 14 July 2025 21:30 Texas recovery efforts could take six months, sheriff says Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said crews could continue search and recovery efforts for up to six months following the deadly floods on Independence Day. “I think we’ll still go strong for another month or two, up to maybe six months winding down,” Leitha said. More than 2,000 people are helping the search efforts. Crews paused on Sunday as the Guadalupe River continued to rise due to heavy rain. “Emergency management it’s a process, and you do it one step at a time and you work through it one step at a time,” Leitha added.

A week after heavy rains pummeled the Texas Hill Country and the flooded Guadalupe River swept hundreds of people overnight, Texans have come together to mourn, search for the many people missing and begin to rebuild. Many questions remain about how storms caught off guard an area prone to flooding and led to the second deadliest flood in Texas history. Here’s what we know.

Credit: Brenda Bazán for The Texas Tribune The floods swept away local residents, summer campers along the river and many visitors who were in the scenic area for the Fourth of July weekend. At least 132 people died across Texas due to flooding. Authorities in Kerr County added several more casualties to its death toll over the weekend, bringing the confirmed total to at least 106 in the county alone. Gov. Greg Abbott also provided updates on other counties on Monday. Travis County added one more casualty, bringing the death toll for the other five counties in Central Texas affected by flooding to 26. Last week, the nearly century-old girls’ Camp Mystic confirmed that 27 campers and counselors were among the dead . With an estimated 101 people still missing across the region, search operations by law enforcement, fire departments and volunteers continue, at times stifled by threats of new flooding. The tragedy has left families like that of Tanya Powell mourning. Her 21-year-old daughter, Ella Rose Cahill, was found dead Tuesday. “It was like a relieved, happy, sad, horrible, wonderful news. I mean, I can't even describe it, because you're so happy that she's still not out there somewhere,” Powell said. “But at the same time, it's like this final moment.” Others, like the father of Ella’s boyfriend. Aidan Heartfield, continue searching through debris and muddy waters, even as hopes to find anyone alive have dimmed. Local authorities have said they haven’t made a live rescue since last week. Aidan’s dad, Thad Heartfield, has been channeling all of his energy into leading volunteer search efforts since the afternoon of July 4. A sliver of hope follows him that Aidan — his kind, smart and gentle 22-year-old son — will rest easy soon. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. “I always think today’s the day I’ll get a call from a DNA match,” Heartfield said Wednesday. “I’m answering a lot of calls from numbers I don’t know. Every one of those calls, I think this could be that call.” Roughly 2,100 emergency responders from 10 states have descended on Kerr County to assist with the recovery and cleanup efforts, according to officials. But the Hill Country’s rough terrain and the flood’s devastation — huge debris piles of trees snapped like toothpicks, pieces of broken buildings and mangled cars — have slowed search efforts.

Greg Abbott listens to Courtney Calhoun, a Kerr County resident and volunteer, during a press conference in Hunt on Tuesday. Credit: Brenda Bazán for The Texas Tribune After failing to pass legislation this spring that would have established a statewide plan to improve Texas’ disaster response, state elected leaders are now promising to address gaps in the state’s flood warning and mitigation systems. With state leaders set to return to the Texas Capitol on July 21 for a special legislative session, elected officials are promising to address gaps in the state’s flood warning and mitigation systems. Gov. Greg Abbott , who called the special session after vetoing a THC ban and sets the agenda for these 30-day, overtime lawmaking periods, ordered lawmakers to pass legislation on the following measures this week: flood warning systems flood emergency communications natural disaster preparation and recovery relief funding for the impacted areas Read more about what lawmakers could do in response to the flooding .

Texas counties have little power to stop construction in flood-prone areas A fallen roof and debris is seen on the banks of the Guadalupe River after intense flooding Tuesday in Ingram. Credit: Ronaldo Bolaños/The Texas Tribune Camp Mystic and many of the other camps along the Guadalupe River sit on land known to be at high risk for a devastating flood. But they’re too far outside any city limits to be more closely regulated. While cities can largely decide what is built, counties in Texas have no jurisdiction to implement comprehensive zoning rules that could limit people from living or building close to the water’s edge. Some federal guardrails for building in floodplains, efforts to relocate residents out of flood zones and programs to fortify infrastructure do exist. But relocation programs have had mixed success and many rural counties in Texas don’t have hazard mitigation plans required for infrastructure assistance. The state’s explosive growth, the appeal of inexpensive flood-prone land and extreme weather make this a pressing concern. A quarter of the state’s land carries some degree of severe flood risk, leaving an estimated 5 million Texans in possible jeopardy. Read more . Time gap between flood warnings and local response raises questions Kerrville City Council and Mayor Joe Herring at an emergency City Council meeting at Kerrville City Hall on Tuesday. Credit: Ronaldo Bolaños/The Texas Tribune Though flooding is familiar to the Hill Country, the high death toll has raised questions about whether forecasters or local officials in charge of emergency response gave people in the area adequate warning. Ahead of the devastation, the National Weather Service on Thursday afternoon issued a flood watch — a threat designation that means the conditions are present for a flood to happen — for Kerr County. At 1:14 a.m., federal forecasters escalated that announcement to a flood warning, a signal that flooding is happening or is imminent. It was sent out three hours and 21 minutes before the first flooding reports came in from low-lying water crossings in the area. The weather service says that first warning triggered one of many automatic alerts to cellphones and weather radios, telling people in the area of the danger. NWS officials said they also communicated directly with local officials during the night of the floods, but did not specify when. In some cases, they said, calls went to voicemail. Kerrville’s mayor said he was unaware of the flooding until around 5:30 a.m., more than four hours after that first warning, when the city manager called and woke him up. Warnings didn’t go up on county Facebook pages until around the same time — when the Guadalupe River had already risen rapidly, spilled out of its banks around Hunt and was making its way toward the county seat of Kerrville. It remains a mystery whether local officials got the NWS’ initial warning and activated in any meaningful way before the flooding. Officials have not provided clear answers, saying their attention is on search and rescue efforts. Read more about the flooding and response timeline .

The Hill Country’s many hills and rivers are a “recipe for catastrophic floods” People look at the Guadalupe River in Kerrville on Sunday as they gather after receiving an alert of potential floods in the area. Credit: REUTERS/Marco Bello The very features that draw people to Texas Hill Country — hills, multiple rivers and rocky terrain ideal for fishing or camping under starry skies — also make it one of the most flood-prone areas in the country. The Balcones Escarpment , a major geological feature that cuts across Central Texas, makes for dramatic views and elevation changes in the area. But it can also lead storms to stall and dump heavy rain, as was the case when leftover moisture from Tropical Storm Barry intensified the storms that caused the flash floods. And when storms roll in, water rushes downhill fast, gaining speed and force as it moves. There’s little to slow it down — thin, rocky soil doesn’t absorb much water, and exposed bedrock and sparse vegetation offer no buffer. Clay-rich soils in parts of the region also prevent infiltration, meaning rain turns to runoff almost immediately. Between 2 and 7 a.m. on July 4, the Guadalupe River in Kerrville rose 35 feet, according to a flood gauge in the area . Hydrologists say it’s a “recipe for catastrophic floods” that has merited the area the nickname of “flash flood alley” and has led to about 30 major flooding events of 20 feet or more in the cities of Kerrville, Hunt and Comfort since 1966.

Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Search and rescue efforts were paused again on Monday in the Hill Country after a storm system brought a new round of dangerous flooding across North and Central Texas over the weekend. While heavy rain prompted several rescues in certain parts of the state on Sunday, no deaths or injuries were reported, as of Monday. More than 160 people are still missing from the catastrophic July 4 floods that hit Kerr County the hardest. By midday Monday, search and rescue efforts were again paused there as rain gauges were reporting that between four to seven inches of rain had fallen and another two inches were expected, according to the Kerr County Joint Information Center Monday. "We expect the water to reach a 14-foot crest and have suspended operations until noon, when we'll re-evaluate," said Levi Bizzell with the Ingram Fire Department. "We’re not sure it’s going to be safe out there for either people or heavy equipment today." The most severe flooding expected for Monday is at the Frio River near Uvalde, which is forecast to reach major flood stage. Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday afternoon that the state was conducting rescues in San Saba, Lampasas and Schleicher counties, with evacuations taking place in Lampasas, Menard, Kimble and Sutton counties. "We are expanding operations in all affected counties — all while monitoring the rising waters in Kerrville," Abbott said in a post on X . Kerrville, in Kerr County, is where rescue and recovery operations have focused after the Fourth of July floods in the Hill Country. Dozens of Texans had been rescued from the Lampasas area by mid-Sunday afternoon, Abbott said. One rescue was made in Schleicher County Sunday morning, according to the county Sheriff’s Office. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Some rescues have also been made in San Saba County, Emergency Management Coordinator Marsha Hardy said, as police and volunteers spread out this morning to alert residents of both mandatory and recommended evacuation orders. By midday Monday, officials in San Saba County had lifted the mandatory evacuation order and determined that Sunday's flood had not result in any injury or loss of life. The flood resulted in one water rescue, damage to two homes in Cherokee, and some re-flooding of homes damaged a week earlier. Sunday’s flood was significant, with the San Saba River reaching almost 31 feet, but it did not reach the 34 foot level of the July 4 flood. "The reality is everything it hit, it stayed in the area of the prior flood… When you’re a week after a slightly more serious flood, that makes things easier,” San Saba County Judge Jody Fauley said. Hardy said the evacuations have gone without issue, and she hopes the rest of the rain won’t cause any more major problems so they can shift to recovery efforts. “It's now a matter, once again, of everybody working their way back home, probably tomorrow, and seeing what kind of damage they might have received,” Hardy said. Sunday afternoon, U.S. Rep. August Pfluger R-Texas, who represents San Saba, posted : “Please take this seriously as the river is rising faster than it did on July 4.” Officials in Kendall and Menard counties told residents in some parts that evacuations are currently voluntary. Emergency crews in Kerr County suspended their search for victims of last week’s flash floods on Sunday morning, resuming in the western parts of Kerr County by 3 p.m. The Ingram Fire Department ordered search crews to immediately evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor until further notice, warning the potential for flash floods was high. Search and rescue efforts were expected to resume on Monday, depending on river flow, Fire Department spokesperson Brian Lochte said. On a Facebook post, the department warned area residents to stay away from river beds and roads. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported "major" floods at the San Saba River at San Saba, which reached 27 feet by 1:30 p.m. Sunday, and at the Lampasas River at Kempner, which reached 33 feet. San Saba County Judge Jody Fauley issued a mandatory evacuation order for some parts of the county as the National Weather Service forecast the San Saba River would crest higher than 31 feet by midnight. By 3:20 p.m. Sunday, floodwaters had begun to recede in Lampasas, said Julian Thorpe, a communications representative at the Lampasas Sheriff's Office. “We’ve made sure everyone has been evacuated from the areas that need to be evacuated. The only ongoing issue that I’m aware of is that the Kempner bridge is blocked off,” Thorpe said, adding that he didn’t have details about rescues in the area. NOAA also reported “moderate” floods at the Leon River at Gatesville and Cowhouse Creek near Pidcoke in Coryell County and at the Llano River near Junction in Kimble County. Sunday evening, the National Weather Service extended its flood watch for the region to 9 a.m. Monday, explaining that one to three inches of rain was possible overnight. An alert from the weather service’s Austin-San Antonio office issued early Sunday warned that the Central Texas region is particularly susceptible to flooding as the soil remains “near to saturation or at saturation levels” from the July 4 storms. That weekend, the destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet on the Guadalupe River in just 45 minutes before daybreak on July 4, washing away homes and vehicles. Ever since, searchers have used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. This summer, flash flooding driven by bursts of heavy rain turned deadly elsewhere in Texas. In San Antonio in June, more than 7 inches of rain fell over a span of hours, prompting dozens of rescues from the fast-rising floodwaters and killing at least 13.

Read Full Bio Emily Mae Czachor Updated on: July 14, 2025 / 7:27 AM EDT / CBS News New flood threat in Central Texas New flooding threat in Texas areas recovering from July 4 floods 02:29 More than 130 people have been confirmed dead after flash floods devastated Central Texas &nbsp;in the early morning of July 4, according to local officials and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The search for more than 160 people still missing was disrupted over the weekend by another round of rain and flooding .&nbsp; The catastrophic&nbsp; July 4 storm caused the Guadalupe River to swell to near-unprecedented levels. More than 100 of those killed, and most of those missing, were in Kerr County, which bore the brunt of the disaster in the flood-prone Texas Hill Country west of Austin, the state capital. President Trump signed a federal disaster declaration at Abbott's request, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy its own teams to support local rescue and recovery efforts as those operations press on. More storms after the initial flooding made efforts especially challenging, officials said.&nbsp; On Friday, July 11, one week after the disaster struck, Mr. Trump arrived in the region to meet with officials, rescue workers and the families of victims.&nbsp; "I've never seen anything like it, a little narrow river that becomes a monster, and that's what happened," Mr. Trump said. "But the first lady and I are here in Texas to express the love and support and the anguish of our entire nation in the aftermath of this really horrific and deadly flood." Camp Mystic tragedy A large majority of the flooding deaths &nbsp;occurred in Kerr County, where officials have confirmed at least 106 people died. At Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp with cabins along the river in a rural part of Kerr County near Hunt, at least 27 campers and counselors died in what the camp described as "catastrophic flooding." Some survivors said they woke up to water rushing through the windows.&nbsp; Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said Wednesday that crews continued to search for five missing campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic. One child not associated with the camp is also missing, Abbott said Tuesday. Items lie scattered inside a cabin at Camp Mystic after deadly flooding in Kerr County, Texas, July 5, 2025. Reuters/Sergio Flores Hundreds of rescuers, including teams from local, state and federal agencies, as well as volunteers, are involved in the search, Texas Game Warden Ben Baker said Tuesday during a news conference.&nbsp; "It's very tragic whenever you see human life. But to see a child in that loss of life, is extremely tragic," Baker told a reporter who had asked about the impacts on rescuers' mental health. Abbott said Tuesday he received a text message from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that said the Department of Health and Human Services is set to declare a public health emergency for the Texas Hill Country flash floods. "This will make it easier for health care and mental health providers from out of state to help both by traveling to the area and by telemedicine," Abbott said the message read. 26 feet of water rose from Guadalupe River Friday, July 4, was the last time a missing person was found alive in Kerr County, according to authorities. But search crews continued to survey miles of the Guadalupe River &nbsp;in the hope of locating others who may have been lost in the floods that inundated Kerr County, Baker told reporters. The river runs for approximately 230 miles through a region that sits between Austin and San Antonio, starting in Kerr County and ending along the Gulf Coast. It's nicknamed "Flash Flood Alley" because the terrain makes it vulnerable to inundation. Officials in five other Texas counties have also confirmed deaths in the flooding: Travis County, which includes Austin, as well as Burnet, Kendall, Williamson and Tom Green County. During the early hours of July 4, the Guadalupe River in Hunt, in Kerr County,&nbsp; rose to about 26 feet &mdash; roughly the height of a two-story building &mdash; over the course of just 45 minutes, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a news conference.&nbsp; Camp Mystic was "horrendously ravaged," Abbott later wrote in a social media post after visiting the site. About 650 people were staying there, including around 550 children, according to inspection records released by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which were dated July 2 &mdash; just two days before the flood. Map shows location of Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas. CBS News According to the records, Camp Mystic had "a written plan of procedures to be implemented in case of a disaster," which was "posted in the camp's administrative on-site office." But exactly what the plan contained isn't clear. Unlike at least one other camp along the Guadalupe River whose employees spoke to The Associated Press, Camp Mystic did not evacuate to higher ground ahead of the floods. Kerr County officials said Wednesday that evacuating from Hill Country is not always the best course of action during a storm, echoing an earlier statement released by a joint information center established in the wake of the floods, which said that disaster responses in the Hill Country terrain are complex. Rural areas, like Hunt, are full of single-lane bridges known as "low water crossings" that easily flood and create scattered "islands" of land that are impassable, said Johnathan Lam of the police department in Kerrville, a city in Kerr County. Those same locations have inconsistent cell service and are hard to reach for first responders. "In Hunt, Highway 39 crisscrosses the Guadalupe again and again and again," Lam said. "And all of those low water crossings, when they flood, they create islands where you can't get in and you can't get out, trapping people in their homes, trapping people in their vehicles. And that's what happened on the morning of July 4." A makeshift crew consisting of two Kerville officers, an emergency room doctor and some volunteer firefighters did what they could to fulfill the duties of a robust response team for 13 hours that first day, until emergency workers in high-profile vehicles were able to reach them at around 5 p.m., Lam said. Scrutiny over weather forecasts Whether communities in the path of the flooding received adequate warnings has been heavily scrutinized and is the subject of ongoing debate. Kerr County officials have largely declined to respond to reporters' inquiries on the matter during their daily news conferences. Some have questioned if the Trump administration's cuts earlier this year to the National Weather Service &nbsp;and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, potentially prevented local forecast offices from sufficiently preparing the public for the extent of the flooding. Mr. Trump and his team have repeatedly rejected any suggestions that federal firings impacted forecasting or emergency preparedness ahead of the floods.&nbsp; A&nbsp; CBS News analysis found that 22 warnings from the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding, which used escalating language as time went on. But some local residents said they did not receive emergency alerts on their phones nor did they understand how serious the situation had truly become until it actually happened. Search and rescue personnel look for missing people along the Guadalupe River on July 7, 2025 in Hunt, Texas.&nbsp; CBS News Texas The San Antonio and San Angelo weather service offices issued warnings for the areas affected by flooding. Officials with the union representing National Weather Service workers told CBS News there are 23 meteorologists staffed between those offices, which together have 10 vacant positions.&nbsp; In San Antonio, the office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a vital role that essentially liaises between forecasters and emergency management agencies in the region to plan how information about an extreme weather event will be disseminated to the public, and which steps to take to protect them. Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his office received a forecast Wednesday that predicted several inches of rain, but "the amount of rain that fell at this specific location was never in any of those forecasts."&nbsp; Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerrville, in Kerr County, said during the same briefing that the storm "dumped more rain than what was forecasted." Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a news conference July 4 that the county does "not have a warning system" in place to alert the public about weather emergencies. County officials had previously&nbsp; discussed a public alarm system but did not proceed with it because of the cost. Former Kerr County commissioner Tom Moser told CBS News the county had applied for a grant in the past to build the system but the application was not approved. "If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it," Lt. Gov. Patrick said Monday, noting that the state could offer resources for Kerr County to implement a system. "We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens. ... If there had been a siren, maybe that would have sparked people to say 'Oh, we have a massive disaster like five minutes away.'" When asked about the emergency warnings on Tuesday, Abbott said everything would be discussed at the state Legislature session.&nbsp; "We're going to address every aspect of this storm to make sure we're going to have in place the systems that are needed to prevent deadly flooding events like this in the future," he told reporters. The board of the Upper Guadalupe River Authority had secured funding and a contract to begin developing a flood monitoring system for the area, with preliminary meetings about the project scheduled for mid-July, according to the joint information center set up since the floods. That project aims to create a "centralized dashboard to support local flood monitoring and emergency response," a spokesperson for the center said in a statement to CBS News.&nbsp; "While real-time streamflow and rainfall data are already available through various sources, this new tool will bring those datasets for Kerr County into one platform to enhance usability for emergency managers," the statement said, adding, "This is not a public alert system, but a decision-support resource intended to complement existing infrastructure."

At some points, water extended for hundreds of feet outside the Guadalupe River&#x27;s banks and beyond FEMA estimates, according to satellite data.

Eric Gay/AP Storms Hurricanes See all topics Facebook Tweet Email Link Link Copied! Follow Just over a week after deadly flash floods swept through central Texas, slow-moving thunderstorms brought heavy rain, and a potential for flash flooding and rapid river rises to the region Sunday. While the most significant rain happened Sunday morning, the chance for more thunderstorms continues into Monday morning, with rivers forecast to continue swelling into flood stage into early next week. A flash flood emergency was issued for southeastern San Saba County, including Colorado Bend State Park, where six to eight inches of rain fell in six hours. In Sutton, Texas, flooding caused cars to stall on Interstate 10 and water was approaching some homes, according to the National Weather Service. San Saba County is about three hours north of Kerr County where officials have reported 106 deaths and at least 140 people still missing following flooding on July 4 . The state conducted water rescues in San Saba County and nearby Lampasas and Schleicher counties Sunday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on X . Some areas of San Saba County were under a mandatory evacuation order due to rainfall in the area, according to a news release. The San Saba Civic Center was opened for those having to evacuate, authorities added . County Judge Jody Fauley said water in some areas had reached at least 30.5’ and was “still rising quickly.” “Torrential rainfall is causing a rapid rise along the San Saba River from Menard to San Saba, San Saba River near San Saba is forecasted to crest at MAJOR category, reaching over 31 feet,” the National Weather Service said on X. Further south in Kerr County, a flood watch remains in effect until 9 a.m. local time Monday due to a band of thunderstorms sliding south, according to the National Weather Service. “We hastily extended the watch as we don’t want to gamble with all the non-stop operations ongoing over the Guadalupe, Colorado, and San Gabriel basins,” forecasters at NWS San Antonio said Sunday evening. “As it stands we expect a low probability say around 10-20 percent that some river impacts over these area come from new overnight rains.” Related article HUNT, TEXAS - JULY 6: A search and rescue worker looks through debris for any survivors or remains of people swept up in the flash flooding on July 6, 2025 in Hunt, Texas.

(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images) ( ) By early Sunday afternoon, most of the heavy rain had moved out of the Kerrville area, but the FOX Forecast Center warned that more rain and thunderstorms would be possible later during the afternoon and evening hours. The Guadalupe River at Kerrville rose above action stage but has since dropped to about 2.5 feet &#x2013; well below the 34.29-foot crest on July 4. Mandatory evacuation issued for parts of San Saba County Watch: Sulphur Creek in Lampasas, Texas, floods on Sunday A video shared from Lampasas, Texas, shows the Sulphur Creek flooding after torrential rain on Sunday, July 13, 2025. A Flash Flood Emergency had been issued for portions of San Saba County early Sunday morning due to the heavy precipitation and thunderstorms, but that has since been allowed to expire. However, officials across the region are still concerned that flooding could impact those who had been impacted by the deadly flooding event last week. The San Saba County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office said numerous roads had been closed due to rushing water, and residents had been warned not to travel over flooded roadways. San Saba County Judge Jody Fauley took to social media on Sunday, urging people to seek higher ground. &quot;If you are in an area that was previously affected or close to being affected last week, please make plans now to move to safety ,&quot; he said in a Facebook post . A mandatory evacuation was also ordered for some areas hit by the flooding last week. &quot;All homes that were damaged last Friday need to evacuate their homes in preparation (of) the river rising quickly throughout the day,&quot; he said in another Facebook post . &quot;Please do not be in this designated area after 1 p.m. (Sunday).&quot; Properties that were close to being impacted last week were told to prepare and have been placed under a recommended evacuation order. &quot;Make plans to evacuate and pay close attention to all water levels,&quot; Fauley said. &quot;We anticipate closures of all major roads in and out of San Saba by the end of the day.&quot; In addition, officials say Colorado Bend State Park would be closed on Monday due to the ongoing flooding. Flood threat rises in Central Texas on Sunday This graphic shows the flash flood threat in Texas on Sunday, July 13, 2025. (FOX Weather) NOAA&#x2019;s Weather Prediction Center (WPC) said most of Texas is at risk of seeing flash flooding on Sunday. However, portions of Central Texas have been placed in a Level 3 out of 4 threat. The FOX Forecast Center said that recent rain and&#xA0;thunderstorms have already saturated the ground in that region, making it easier for flooding to occur. Computer forecast models &#xA0;have signaled that the most intense rain would likely fall before sunrise on Sunday before the rain and thunderstorms move off to the east and southeast. With that setup, the FOX Forecast Center said rivers and streams, like the Guadalupe River, could rise rapidly. This graphic shows the river gauge for the Lampasas River at Kempner, Texas. (FOX Weather) The Lampasas River near&#xA0; Kempner , Texas, crested at 32.45 feet on Sunday morning, just under major flood stage. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the Lampasas River was at 1.75 feet at 4 a.m. local time and rose to more than 32 feet at 9:15 a.m. Major flood stage at that location begins at 33 feet. This graphic shows the top rain totals in Texas so far on Sunday, July 13, 2025. (FOX Weather) Rain totals have been rising all morning, with about 9.30 inches of rain falling in San Saba. About 6.37 inches of rain fell at Colorado Bend State Park, and&#xA0; Sonora &#xA0;picked up just over 6 inches of rain. Brady &#xA0;picked up about 5.24 inches of rain while Killeen received 4.89 inches. Editor&#x2019;s Note: This story has been updated to adjust the FOX Forecast Center&apos;s revised calculation for the rate of floodwater in the Lampasas River. This remains a developing story.

Photo credit: HS2 Ltd Click here to listen to the latest rail news on Monday, 14th July 2025. InTheNews: The latest rail news on Monday 14 July 2025 Lord Peter Hendy told BBC Radio 4 that the northern legs of the high-speed rail network were &ldquo;under consultation&rdquo; and revealed that the land is still being held by HS2. An article on the Yorkshire Post website says the original route would have connected London to Birmingham, with trains then going on to Manchester and Leeds to deal with capacity issues on both lines. It would have cut the journey time from Leeds to Birmingham from almost two hours to less than 50 minutes, and would also have connected Sheffield to the network. However, in 2021 Boris Johnson scrapped the Leeds leg and in 2023 Rishi Sunak axed the Manchester segment, with mayors describing it as a &ldquo;betrayal of the North&rdquo;. The number of prosecutions for fare evasion on London Underground has risen to its highest level for six years, figures seen by the BBC show. An article on the BBC website says Transport for London (TfL) prosecuted 3,691 people on the Tube in 2024-25, and also issued 13,118 penalty fare notices (PFNs) and 850 written warnings. In the same period, there was a record number of PFNs (12,527) handed out on London Overground but the number of prosecutions (3,044) fell by a third on the previous year. Some 440 warnings were issued. TfL says fare evasion is “not a victimless crime” and “robs Londoners of vital investment”, adding that it was “committed to reducing the current rate of fare evasion to 1.5% by 2030”. Redevelopment plans for a railway station could require up to &pound;1.4 million of funding which councillors will be asked to approve next week. An article on the South Wales Argus says the UK Government has already agreed to make &pound;5.2m available for an overhaul of Chepstow railway station, and other public transport improvements in the town, though that will not include accessibility improvements despite there being no disabled access to the westbound platform. Monmouthshire County Council is being asked to provide &ldquo;match funding&rdquo; of 30 per cent towards the scheme. No trains will call at Stockport station for three weeks when a &pound;20m project to replace a bridge in the town centre begins next month An article on the BBC website says the West Coast Main Line will be closed from 2 August as part of the work by Network Rail. It means no trains will run on the line between Manchester Piccadilly and Stoke-on-Trent via Macclesfield and Cheadle Hulme, the operator has said. There will also be no train services on various other lines into Stockport.

Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commutes Resume After Midtown Bus Terminal Crash Chaos Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Massachusetts to Follow NYC in Making Landlords Pay Broker Fees Foreign Buyers Swoop on Cape Town Homes, Pricing Out Locals What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing A steady stream of sales by long-time whales — miners, offshore funds and anonymous wallets — is being met almost one-for-one by demand from institutional players like ETFs, corporates and asset managers. The result: Bitcoin is struggling to break out of its record high around $110,000, volatility is evaporating, and its place in the investment landscape is being reshaped. Despite a flurry of bullish headlines — from corporate treasuries embracing Bitcoin to the Trump administration’s full-throated crypto endorsement — the largest digital currency has remained stuck in its trading range for months. Underneath the surface, long-dormant whales have been trimming positions just as institutions ramp up their buying. And this switchover is gradually recasting Bitcoin’s identity from a high-octane trade to a slow-burn allocation. Over the past year, large holders, or Bitcoin whales, have offloaded more than 500,000 Bitcoin — worth over $50 billion at current prices — according to data compiled by 10x Research. That’s roughly equal to the net inflows into the wildly successful US exchange-traded funds since their approval. And it’s not far off from the $65 billion amassed over the past five years by crypto treasury pioneer Michael Saylor and his firm, now known as Strategy ( MSTR ). Many of these whales trace back to Bitcoin’s earliest cycles, when it traded far below current levels. In some cases, whales aren’t simply selling, they’re swapping tokens for deals tied to the stock market, bypassing the open market. “What we’re seeing is a churning in the base,” said Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital. “A less covered driver and potential reason for the churn and increasing network activity seems to be driven by whales converting their BTC into equity exposure through in-kind contributions of BTC into financing transactions tied to the public markets.” Institutions — from ETFs and Saylor’s Strategy to dozens of corporate imitators — now control about a quarter of all Bitcoin in circulation. Back in 2020, researcher Flipside Crypto estimated that about 2% of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain controlled 95% of the digital asset. The power dynamic is shifting fast. Story Continues “Crypto is becoming less of an outlier and more established as a legitimate asset class,” said Rob Strebel, head of relationship management at the trading firm DRW, which includes crypto-focused arm Cumberland. Alongside that shift, “we expect to see a compression in volatility.” That appears to be already taking place, dampening one of the most alluring aspects of Bitcoin to many traders. A closely watched measure of price swings has declined to the lowest level in about two years, according to Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index. The gauge monitors the 30-day forward-looking annualized expectations of volatility. While the whales cut exposure, ETFs, treasury companies and other institutions combined have absorbed nearly 900,000 coins in the past year, according to 10x Research. These players now hold about 4.8 million coins, out of about 20 million Bitcoin in circulation. But even as institutions bring stability and legitimacy to the asset class, some observers warn they’re also providing the long-awaited exit ramp for whales, raising the risk that it’s retail and retirement investors left holding the bag if crypto sentiment falters. “The goal for a long time has always been to make Bitcoin a palatable asset for institutional investors to provide exit liquidity in volume so the whales could cash out,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law, a long-time crypto skeptic. After two straight years in which the price more than doubled, Bitcoin is still hovering around levels reached at the start of the year, despite President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Some analysts now expect Bitcoin’s appreciation to be capped at 10% to 20% a year. That’s a far cry from 2017’s almost 1,400% surge that pushed the token into the mainstream. “Bitcoin is probably more like boring dividend stock over time,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca. “On average it goes higher every year, but by less and less amount. It becomes more of an attractive retirement asset.” Still, the picture is incomplete. Not all whale activity is visible, and Bitcoin could prove ever-volatile soon enough, especially if a new market catalyst emerges. Regardless, one big risk right now is imbalance: If Bitcoin whales resume selling at scale while institutional flows plateau, the market could tip into steep declines. Outflows of just 2% in 2018 and 9% in 2022 triggered Bitcoin price drops of 74% and 64%, respectively, according to 10x Research. “We are nearing a point where the market is hitting its peak,” said Fred Thiel, chief executive officer of Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings Inc., which has yet to sell any of its Bitcoin holdings. “My personal belief, however, is we are in a very different market dynamic today.” All told, the shift from anonymous whales to institutional allocators may help sustain the current market dynamic for an extended period. “This can go on for a long time — years,” said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. “It’s more of a slow grind, where Bitcoin becomes more of a 10%-20% asset. The nature of Bitcoin really changes.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek SNAP Cuts in Big Tax Bill Will Hit a Lot of Trump Voters Too America’s Top Consumer-Sentiment Economist Is Worried How to Steal a House China’s Homegrown Jewelry Superstar Sperm Freezing Is a New Hot Market for Startups ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Family, fellow officers, first responders, and city leaders gathered at police headquarters. Police Chaplain Pastor Jonas Bundy led the invocation, remembering Wallin as a courageous public servant who gave his life protecting others. The ceremony included remarks from Police Chief Dave Zibolski, a presentation to Wallin’s parents, the playing of taps, and the ringing of a memorial bell. Two tribute videos were shown, including one highlighting a new training room named in Wallin’s honor. Zibolski called Wallin “a committed, energetic officer” and said the memorial helps bring closure to a tragic loss. Officers Tyler Hawes and Andrew Dotas, who were also shot that day, and Zach Robinson, who stopped the gunman, were in attendance. &gt;&gt;Moorhead Standoff Ends Safely After Suspect Flees Traffic Stop (Moorhead, MN) &#8212; A standoff in south Moorhead ended without injury Monday after a suspect fled a traffic stop and entered a home. Authorities say the man had no connection to the home or the two people inside, who were able to escape safely. The suspect had earlier fled from a Clay County deputy, tossing a backpack from the vehicle before it was stopped with spike strips in a nearby field. SWAT officers entered the home through the garage and ordered the man to surrender. He was taken into custody without incident and brought to a hospital for evaluation. &gt;&gt;Benson Man Sentenced in Deadly Drug Case (Benson, MN) — A Benson man has been sentenced to over 13 years in prison for selling drugs that led to a Willmar man’s death. 28-year-old Lateef Mahaffey Jr. received a 158-month sentence Monday, with credit for nearly two years already served. Mahaffey was convicted of third-degree murder and other charges after selling fentanyl-laced drugs in September 2022. The victim was later found dead in his bathtub. Mahaffey was also ordered to pay over $14,000 in restitution for funeral costs. A co-defendant, Mercedes Carpenter of Maynard, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and will be sentenced on September 29th. The victim’s family expressed anger on social media that Mahaffey refused to attend the sentencing and did not hear their impact statements. &gt;&gt;Bringing Lawmakers and Families Together (St. Paul, MN) &#8212; A community event at the State Capitol tonight is bringing lawmakers and families together to focus on youth safety. DFL Representative María Isa Pérez-Vega is inviting residents from her district to attend. She says the goal is to connect with lawmakers in a meaningful way. She says, &#8220;This kickoff event is crucial when we talk about bringing folks to the Capitol complex and connecting with lawmakers like me, who represent this district with the force and the inspiration to bring this law to the plate.&#8221; The event runs until 8:30 tonight and features food trucks, games, and live music. Organizers say it’s a chance to have fun while discussing serious issues, such as protecting children and strengthening communities. &gt;&gt;Looking Ahead to Next Legislative Session ST. PAUL, Minn. — Ahead of the next legislative session, a Republican lawmaker is calling for more transparency at the Capitol. Senator Michael Kreun (KROON) of Blaine says too much of the work on final budget bills happened behind closed doors. He says, &#8220;Minnesota has a transparency problem. When discussing the details of the law with these working groups, every single one should have been open to the public, because that&#8217;s where the law is being made. And we have to remember that our government belongs to the people, and we can&#8217;t lose sight of that.&#8221; Kreun also criticized how lawmakers were notified about the closure of the Stillwater prison in Bayport. He says there should have been public hearings and open discussions before that decision was made. &gt;&gt;Moorhead Man Dies of Medical Emergency on Otter Tail County Lake (Pelican Rapids, MN) &#8212; Authorities in Otter Tail County are investigating the weekend death of a Moorhead man on Pelican Lake.

The Donald Trump-Rosie O&#39;Donnell feud is picking up, and there&#39;s a new player involved ! Donald Trump and Rosie O&#39;Donnell have a longstanding feud that goes back to at least 2006. Over the years, O&#39;Donnell has called Trump a &quot;snake-oil salesman&quot; and has criticized his hateful policies and boorish behavior. Trump has mainly attacked O&#39;Donnell&#39;s appearance and womanhood, calling her &quot;unattractive,&quot; &quot;disgusting,&quot; a &quot;slob,&quot; and saying she has a &quot;fat, ugly face.&quot; Last year, O&#39;Donnell moved from the U.S. to Ireland due to Trump&#39;s re-election. &quot;When you know it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,&quot; she said. &quot;It has been heartbreaking to see what is happening over there politically, and hard for me personally as well. The personal is political, as we all know.&quot; Now, Trump is threatening to revoke O&#39;Donnell&#39;s U.S. citizenship . &quot;Because of the fact that Rosie O&#39;Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,&quot; he wrote on Truth Social. &quot;She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!&quot; O&#39;Donnell clapped back, calling Trump &quot;a danger to the nation&quot; and a &quot;truly evil man child.&quot; She also shared a picture of Trump smiling with his arm around sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. &quot;hey donald — you&#39;re rattled again? 18 years later and I still live rent-free in that collapsing brain of yours,&quot; O&#39;Donnell wrote in the caption. &quot;you call me a threat to humanity — but I&#39;m everything you fear: a loud woman a queer woman a mother who tells the truth an american who got out of the country b4 u set it ablaze.&quot; Now, a new player has entered the clash: Ellen DeGeneres. Despite having a feud that goes back to 2004, DeGeneres is standing behind O&#39;Donnell , sharing an Instagram post of Trump and O&#39;Donnell&#39;s comments with the caption &quot;Good for you @rosie.&quot; Keep reading to find out our Man Crush Monday and all the best pop culture news!

In the second part, long-forgotten injustices surrounding the destruction of temples and land grabs come to light, revealing the terrible history of a spirit seeking retribution who is closely connected to Mithra's family. Vir Das: Fool Volume - July 18 (Netflix) This Netflix special revives the comedian's trademark multi-city approach, which weaves various stages, cultures, and moods. You may be wondering what has changed this time. Vir became creatively and physically speechless just weeks before recording his career-defining show. His subsequent show, Fool Volume , was his most introspective to that point. Vir tackles everything from solitude and insecurity to rediscovering happiness with his signature combination of humor, empathy, and an amount of irreverence that will make your parents apprehensive. This comedy does not hold back; instead, it actively engages with its audience. At a time when criticism and sarcasm abound, Vir Das: Fool Volume serves as a breath of fresh air. He demonstrates the power of comedy, the importance of laughter in building connections, and the possibility that compassion is the most hilarious quality, whether on large stages or in unexpected parts of the world.

(Getty Images/iStockphoto) By Rob Nikolewski | rob.nikolewski@sduniontribune.com | The San Diego Union-Tribune PUBLISHED: July 14, 2025 at 12:14 PM PDT Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday touted that in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available — renewable and clean sources of energy accounted for 67% of California&#8217;s power. In addition, Newsom said so far this year, nine out of 10 days on California&#8217;s electric grid were powered at least part of the day by what the state defines as clean-energy resources. &#8220;California is the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy,&#8221; a news release from the governor&#8217;s office said, adding that the sources of clean energy include not just solar and wind power but also hydroelectricity, nuclear, geothermal and biomass. &#8220;Not since the Industrial Revolution have we seen this kind of rapid transformation,&#8221; Newsom said in the news release. Gary Ackerman, a utilities and energy consultant with more than four decades of experience in California power issues, acknowledged the statistics but offered a &#8220;sober reminder&#8221; of the steady rise in utility bills that customers across the Golden State pay each month. &#8220;California’s electricity rates are among the highest in the U.S., driven by spending on wildfire risk mitigation, grid upgrades and clean energy mandates,&#8221; Ackerman said in an email to the Union-Tribune. &#8220;The state’s legislature is actively pursuing reforms to cap profits, shift upgrade costs to industry users and protect average households. However, substantial policy and billing changes will take time to implement.&#8221; For years, California has added significant amounts of renewable energy to its electric grid to meet the state&#8217;s mandate to derive 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045. Three years ago, Newsom set benchmarks for the state to reach 90% electricity from renewable and zero-carbon resources by 2035 and 95% by 2040 . To help reach those goals, some 25,000 megawatts of new energy resources have been added to the state&#8217;s grid since 2019, with most of that being solar and battery storage. Of the 67% of renewable and clean-designated resources mentioned in Monday&#8217;s news release, 12% in 2023 came from large hydroelectric generation, another 12% came from nuclear power and the remaining 43% came from assorted renewable resources. The numbers came from a dashboard posted by the California Energy Commission . As for the statistic mentioning that clean energy has powered more than nine of of 10 days, that comes from a calculation by the California Independent System Operator, the grid manager that serves about 80% of the state&#8217;s electricity demand. So far this year, the grid has been powered by 100% clean energy for an average of almost seven hours each day. Over the course of 2024, the figure came to 3.3 hours.

What Trump’s megabill means for you EPA announces settlement on cleanup of Otay Mesa battery fire California’s gas tax kicks in: How much more will drivers pay at the pump? California Energy Commission calls for shelving plans to fine oil companies But it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that wind and solar power are intermittent sources of electricity — that is, solar is not produced when the sun does not shine and wind generation drops to practically zero when the wind doesn’t blow. Power sources such as natural gas can fill the gaps, but natural gas is a fossil fuel. That&#8217;s why California policymakers are increasingly counting on battery storage, which emits no carbon dioxide, to pick up the slack. The amount of battery storage capacity in the state has mushroomed nearly 2,000% since 2019, reaching 15,763 megawatts as of Jan. 31 of this year . But all that costs money and spending on clean energy programs to meet the state&#8217;s greenhouse gas reduction targets is one of the drivers of higher electricity rates that utility customers pay. The average per kilowatt-hour price for electricity has roughly doubled since 2013 for all three major investor-owned utilities in the state — San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison — according to an annual report from the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC. The report predicts electric rates will rise 5.6% to 10.8% annually through 2027, well over the rate of inflation. CPUC officials say they&#8217;re focused on affordability concerns and reining in rate increases. In Sacramento, a slew of energy- and utility-related bills are wending their way through the Legislature. Newsom&#8217;s announcement Monday comes on the heels of President Donald Trump signing what was dubbed the &#8220;One Big Beautiful Bill&#8221; that included energy provisions that rolled back federal spending and tax credits for renewable resources such as wind and solar. “As the federal government turns its back on innovation and commonsense, California is making our clean energy future a reality,&#8221; Newsom said. Newsom spent two days last week touring South Carolina , home to an early and crucial presidential primary, fueling speculation that he will enter the race to be the Democratic nominee in the 2028 presidential campaign.

They show that omission of critical data often results in a deceit. TWTW continues with another omission of data that helped the acceptance of the Linear No Threshold Model and concludes with a brief discussion of the recent flood in Texas. ********************* A Deceit: After Dr. Jane Orient began the 42 nd annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness (DDP) with a welcoming address, Astrophysicist Willie Soon delivered a lecture loaded with information. Fortunately, TWTW obtained the slides and the video and is able to post the slides, which are easier to follow. The lecture is titled “How well can we measure the Earth’s energy budget? An Ongoing Scientific Discussion” and was developed in collaboration with Soon’s colleagues Ronan and Michael Connolly. The importance of Earth’s energy budget was presented in the series of ten brief papers on “Basic Climate Physics” by Howard “Cork” Hayden posted on the SEPP website in 2022. How much energy does Earth receive from the Sun and how much is Earth transmitting to space? [For these calculations, the energy within the Earth left over from its formation and from radioactive decay is so small these calculations are not needed for basic calculations.] If Earth is receiving more radiation than it is transmitting to space, Earth will warm. If it is transmitting more energy to space than it is receiving from the sun, Earth will cool. The major problem is that we cannot measure the Greenhouse Effect directly. So, one must calculate the difference between two large numbers to find a small one. A small percentage error in either of the large numbers will result in a large error in the small one, and may even change the sign of the difference, say from positive to negative. In his essays, Hayden explains how William van Wijngaarden and William Happer were able to make the calculations using the detailed HITRAN database. [“HITRAN is an acronym for high-resolution transmission molecular absorption database. HITRAN is a compilation of spectroscopic parameters that a variety of computer codes use to predict and simulate the transmission and emission of light in the atmosphere. HITRAN data is predominantly used in atmospheric science and astrophysics, but it has many applications throughout science, industry, and technology.” https://hitran.org/ ] The database is updated frequently. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body&#8217;s thermodynamic temperature (Kelvin), Hayden showed how van Wijngaarden and Happer can calculate the Greenhouse Effect defined by the IPCC to be the difference between the amount of IR emitted by the surface and the IR emitted to space, (for clear skies). Thus, the Earth’s energy budget can be calculated from observations, physical evidence. Willie Soon went into detail showing how the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change arrived at its Earth’s energy budget for which it blames human emissions of carbon dioxide for causing what is called dangerous global warming. Soon begins that section of his lecture with a slide stating: “On the hypothetical EEI (Earth Energy Imbalance) index invented by James Hansen (or how Hansen thinks that Earth system can magically figure out that only the man-made part of the atmospheric CO2 will cause imbalances in the energy equilibration process?)” As evidence, Soon provides two 2005 papers with James Hansen the lead author. The first is “Earth&#8217;s Energy Imbalance: Confirmation and Implications” published by AAAS Science. The abstract states: “ Our climate model, driven mainly by increasing human-made greenhouse gases and aerosols, among other forcings, calculates that Earth is now absorbing 0.85 ± 0.15 watts per square meter more energy from the Sun than it is emitting to space. This imbalance is confirmed by precise measurements of increasing ocean heat content over the past 10 years. Implications include (i) the expectation of additional global warming of about 0.6°C without further change of atmospheric composition; (ii) the confirmation of the climate system&#8217;s lag in responding to forcings, implying the need for anticipatory actions to avoid any specified level of climate change; and (iii) the likelihood of acceleration of ice sheet disintegration and sea level rise.” [Boldface by Soon] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1110252 Soon points out that Hansen’s Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) “is a model-derived speculation, not a measured quantity (see the root in Hansen et al. 2005).” Soon states: “The origin of the ‘disequilibrium’ brought forth strictly because of the human-component of the CO2 in the air:” Then Soon shows the slide “The original speculation of EEI by Hansen et al., (1985).” The paper is “Climate Response Times: Dependence on Climate Sensitivity and Ocean Mixing” published by AAAS Science with James Hansen the lead author. The abstract reads: “The factors that determine climate response times were investigated with simple models and scaling statements. The response times are particularly sensitive to (i) the amount that the climate response is amplified by feedbacks and (ii) the representation of ocean mixing. If equilibrium climate sensitivity is 3°C or greater for a doubling of the carbon dioxide concentration, then most of the expected warming attributable to trace gases added to the atmosphere by man probably has not yet occurred. This yet to be realized warming calls into question a policy of &#8220;wait and see&#8221; regarding the issue of how to deal with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and other trace gases.” [Boldface by Soon] https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Climate+Response+Times:+Dependence+on+Climate+Sensitivity+and+Ocean+Mixing&#038;hl=en&#038;as_sdt=0&#038;as_vis=1&#038;oi=scholart Soon states that EEI was not a scientific deduction but “was wholly invented essentially to ‘kill/destroy’ the ‘wait and see’ policy response, not a scientific deduction.” From the text Soon cites [references omitted here]: “There is evidence that some mechanisms of ocean overturning are capable of sudden changes, and the paleoclimate record reveals cases of large warming within periods of no more than several decades. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the climate at some point undergo a rapid transition to the equilibrium climate for current atmospheric compositions.” [ The boldface was underlined by Soon.] Soon states: “EEI was wholly invented essentially to ‘kill/destroy’ the ‘wait and see’ policy response, not a scientific deduction.” Soon then shows a number of slides updating these questionable assertions by Hansen with the leading one stating: “More magical updates on EEI time series by NASA GISS director, Dr. Gavin Schmidt (2024)?” [Boldface added] To this, TWTW adds that the Greenland Ice Cores, confirmed by the geological records taken around the world shows that many Heinrich and Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) Events have occurred and these are unexplained. The D-O events are marked by abrupt warming about every 1500 years followed by gradual cooling. These are unrelated to atmospheric carbon dioxide and there is no basis for Hansen, et al. to assume that they are. Soon continues with many slides supporting his assertion that the claim that CO2 is causing dangerous global warming is the result of speculating using models, not the result of physical evidence, either from experiments or from observations. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy and https://www.sepp.org/science_papers.cfm?whichyear=2022 for the Hayden papers. ********************* A Myth: As with Willie Soon, John Clauser delivered a lecture loaded with information and references. Only one key point will be discussed in this TWTW. Clauser is a retired experimental and theoretical physicist and the 2022 Physics Nobel Laureate. One of his slides stated he is a Climate Change Denier. Clauser titled his presentation: “Climate change is a scam &#8211; A cloud thermostat stably controls the Earth’s climate, not greenhouse gasses. There is no climate crisis! Serious mistakes and fudges in the IPCC’s global power balance assessment.” The first slide in the lecture stated [red in original]: “Climate change is a myth, promoted by a scam. • The IPCC and its various collaborators have been tasked to use computer modeling and observational data from satellites, ocean bathymetry, and a global network of surface radiation measurements to determine some very important parameters for the Earth’s climate, including: • The Earth’s so-called power imbalance, thereby to prove the IPCC’s assertion of global warming, • The Earth’s associated global average temperature history, and • The Earth’s natural power-balance feedback-stability strength. • Based on these parameters, the IPCC and its various collaborators have been tasked to identify the dominant process or processes that control the Earth’s climate. • In my opinion, the IPCC and its collaborators have grossly botched all of these efforts, and have, prejudicially, erroneously, and dishonestly claimed that there is global warming, in turn, leading to a climate change crisis! • As a result, their whole argument leads to their claims of an impending climate catastrophe. • I show here that their arguments are bogus. Instead, there is a very powerful naturally occurring dominant feedback mechanism that fully stabilizes the Earth’s temperature, irrelevantly of the atmosphere’s content of greenhouse gasses.” Following this are slides stating: “The IPCC’s flawed house-of-cards: Based on the IPCC’s claimed power imbalance and its associated global warming assertion; the IPCC and its collaborators assemble a flawed house of-cards argument that forebodes an impending climate change apocalypse /catastrophe.” Next slide: “The IPCC’s house of cards consists of the following arguments: The IPCC dishonestly claims to have observed a net power imbalance in the Earth’s radiation budget, thereby proving that global warming is real. Global warming (if proven), in turn, leads to climate change. Climate change, in turn, leads to an increased frequency of extreme weather events and other bad phenomena. An increased frequency of extreme weather events, in turn, leads to a global apocalypse and to a climate crisis. The IPCC’s collaborator, NOAA, dishonesty claims to have actually observed an increasing extreme weather event frequency. The IPCC’s repeated bogus claims of a net warming power imbalance of 0.6 ± 0.2 W/m2 is further claimed to be caused by a buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gasses, especially of CO2, by the addition of a so-called radiative forcing of this power imbalance by about 2 W/m2. The IPCC demands that trillions of dollars be spent to limit, prevent, and reverse the atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gasses.” New slide: “I assert that the IPCC’s house of cards has collapsed. I assert that the IPCC and its contributors have not observed a net power imbalance! I assert that the IPCC and its contributors have not proven global warming! I assert that NOAA has not observed an increased frequency of extreme weather events! Without a net power imbalance and the resulting global warming, there is no climate-change crisis! Their house of cards has thus collapsed! There is no cl

In this plan 10 goals were set out, with Thriving Plants and Wildlife the apex goal into which all other goals feed in to. Later in 2025 we will publish a revision of the EIP (EIP25) to protect and restore our natural environment. EIP25 will include delivery information to set out how we will meet the ambitious Environment Act targets. The government’s number one mission is to kickstart economic growth. We know that the natural resources that underpin our economy are finite and under increasing pressure. The natural environment is amongst our most valuable national assets. EIP25 will set out the approach to improving the natural environment we need to take to grow our economy, build 1.5 million homes, boost food security and meet our environment and climate targets with nature as the enabler, driver and protector of growth. Improving on EIP23, EIP25 will be a clearer, prioritised plan for achieving environmental outcomes such as reducing waste across the economy, planting more trees, improving air quality and halting the decline in species. Our revised EIP will be a document that guides action and decision making, with achievable delivery plans for restoring nature and improving the natural environment, underpinned by world-leading environmental science and consultation with experts. The EIP25 will include a clearer monitoring and evaluation framework through which we will assess progress and interim target delivery. As part of EIP25, we are committed to strengthening our annual reporting on progress and changes to the condition of the natural environment using the monitoring and evaluation framework. In next year’s annual progress report, we will report on progress made under EIP25. Overview In 2023 the Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP23) was published, in accordance with the Environment Act 2021, as a revision of the 25 Year Environment Plan (25YEP) published in 2018. This annual progress report covers April 2024 to March 2025. EIP23 is set out in 10 goals. Each goal has specific targets and commitments described in the EIP23 that contribute to the goal outcome, including the legally binding targets set under the Environment Act 2021. The annual progress report is set out under these goals. This report provides a selection of key achievement updates related to each EIP23 goal. The 10 goals are: Thriving plants and wildlife Clean air Clean and plentiful water Managing exposure to chemicals and pesticides Maximise our resources, minimise our waste Using resources from nature sustainably Mitigating and adapting to climate change Reduced risk of harm from environmental hazards Enhancing biosecurity Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment Further information on progress towards the targets can be found in the accompanying monitoring annex, which forms part of the annual progress report. Apex Goal: Thriving plants and wildlife There are 6 legally binding Environment Act targets, and 5 interim targets associated with the apex goal of ‘thriving plants and wildlife’. More information on these can be found in the accompanying monitoring annex. Goal 1: Thriving plants and wildlife Achieving thriving plants and wildlife is the apex goal of the EIP23. Achieving all the other EIP23 goals will support achieving the thriving plants and wildlife goal. Key activities over the past year Since the period covered by the annual progress report for 2024 (APR24), the following additional progress has been delivered. Habitats and species In May 2024, the Management of Hedgerows (England) Regulations 2024 introduced management rules into domestic legislation to protect hedgerows on land used for agriculture in England. Between April 2024 and March 2025 Natural England declared a further 4 new National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and significantly extended another. In October 2024, we confirmed our vision for delivering 30by30 on land in England and published the criteria for areas which can count towards this target. The government allocated £13 million to Protected Site Strategies to create and implement restoration plans for priority sites where nature recovery can also contribute to the government growth mission in 2025 to 2026. Between Oct 2024 and April 2025, we ran 2 phases of 30by30 pilots with a small number of partners, to inform the ongoing development of 30by30 guidance and assessment and reporting processes, which are both crucial for enabling 30by30 rollout. Between April 2024 and March 2025 Natural England declared 4 new National Nature Reserves and extended another by more than 7 times its original size. Combined, these ‘King’s Series’ declarations increased the area of National Nature Reserves by almost 5.5%, to over 115,000 hectares. Green finance The Defra-sponsored BSI Nature Investment Standards Programme published a new Biodiversity Standard (BSI Flex 702) for consultation. We have commenced work on new urban nature markets, starting with an urban greening code which is linked to the British Standards Institution (BSI) - BSI Flex. An announcement is expected shortly on the successful grantees who collectively will receive £15 million capacity and capability grant funding. In 2024 to 2025, the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund evaluation demonstrated strong results. 86 projects have been supported in England across rounds 1 and 2, and of these, 17 projects have secured additional investment up to £2.5 million, and 4 projects generated over £2.9 million in environmental unit sales. The third funding round launched in June 2024, bringing total supported projects to 127. Land use In April 2024, biodiversity net gain (BNG) became mandatory for small sites (unless exempt) following its introduction for larger sites 2 months prior to that. To note that recently in May 2025 the government launched a consultation on improving the implementation of biodiversity net gain for minor, medium and brownfield development, as well as a consultation on how BNG will apply to nationally significant infrastructure projects from May 2026. Between April 2024 and March 2025, 2 Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs) were published, and a further 13 had begun or completed the required public consultation on their draft strategy. The remaining 33 were either preparing to consult or at an earlier stage of the preparation process. In February 2025, government published updated Planning Practice Guidance to explain how planning authorities should consider LNRSs. In March 2025 the Planning and Infrastructure Bill was introduced into Parliament. Nature Restoration Fund measures in the Bill will unlock the positive impact development can have in driving the recovery of protected sites and species. The Planning and Infrastructure Bill also proposes that Spatial Development Strategies will have to take account of LNRSs and that Natural England will have to have regard to LNRSs when preparing Environmental Delivery Plans. In October 2024, we launched the Nature Towns and Cities programme. This coalition is working together to deliver greener, fairer, healthier and more connected towns, cities and neighbourhoods. This will enable millions more people to enjoy nature close to home. The goal of this programme is to ensure at least 30% of green and blue space network contributes to nature’s recovery. The Green Infrastructure (GI) Framework has been live for one year. Natural England has worked proactively with over 60 local authorities to embed GI standards within local plans and policies, which results in a nature positive approach to development and growing the economy. Farming The Farming in Protected Landscapes programme (FiPL) was originally set to run until the end of March 2024. In recognition of the positive feedback and outcomes delivered by FiPL, we extended the programme until March 2026 and increased the overall funding to £130 million. The programme will continue to help Protected Landscapes teams work with farmers and land managers to deliver more for climate, nature, people and places. The expanded sustainable farming incentive offer (SFI24) launched in May 2024, including 102 actions covering all farm types in England. This includes actions on soil health, moorland, hedgerows, integrated pest management, farmland wildlife, buffer strips, agroforestry, precision farming, and grassland. In March 2025, with 37,000 live multi-year SFI agreements and the sustainable farming budget successfully allocated, the scheme was closed to new applications. We have a record number of farmers in Environmental Land Management agreements, and continue to refine and improve the offer. Trees and woodlands Government supported the planting of 5,765 ha of woodland and 888,000 trees outside woodland in England between April 2024 and March 2025, equivalent to a total of 7,164 ha of tree canopy and woodland cover or 10.4 million trees. In July 2024, the Forest for Cornwall announced it had reached a major milestone of planting one million trees since it was created in January 2019. In November 2024, a Defra-commissioned review was published which analysed how provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) relating to ancient woodland and ancient and veteran trees were applied in practice. In late November and early December 2024, the government celebrated National Tree Week with activities including publication of the Tree Species Guide for UK Agroforestry Systems. As part of this, the government also launched a UK-wide Tree Planting Taskforce, which brought ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland together, alongside key delivery partners and arm’s-length bodies, to work to resolve barriers to tree planting, boost biodiversity and grow the UK’s forestry sector to help meet net zero targets. In March 2025, the new Western Forest was announced, the first new national forest in over 30 years. The Western Forest will see 20 million trees planted across the west of England by 2050 and the creation of 2,500 hectares of new woodland by 2030. This is the first step towards delivering the government’s manifesto commitment to create 3 new national forests. Global environment In April 2024, the government funded the first project under Darwin Plus Strategic. This is a new grant scheme designed to fund larger-scale, longer-term conservation projects in and between the UK Overseas Territories. At the 16th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity the UK co-chaired the negotiations of the new multilateral benefit sharing mechanism, facilitating the launch of the Cali Fund. This global fund provides a route for companies using genetic information from nature to contribute finance for biodiversity. A strategy for raising finance from all sources for delivery of the Global Biodiversity Framework was agreed. The independent International Advisory Panel on Biodiversity Credits (co-sponsored by UK and French Governments) also launched a Framework for high integrity biodiversity credit markets, bringing together High-Level Principles, market actor guidance and pilot projects to help accelerate investment in nature. Defra has continued to deliver its Official Development Assistance (ODA) portfolio which is focused on tackling nature loss, climate change and poverty reduction in developing countries. In 2024 to 2025 this has included continued implementation of the Biodiverse Landscapes Fund, continued delivery of the Darwin Initiative and Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund which conserve biodiversity and safeguard the environment for local people. This is alongside delivery of the Blue Planet Fund, including the marine challenge fund OCEAN which works to build resilience for coastal people and communities. Alongside this we are continuing support to addre
