- Grok 4 AI cites Elon Musk? Users say xAI model leans on X posts and news about Musk for controversial topics - India Today: Grok 4, xAI's AI chatbot, is criticized for basing responses to controversial topics on Elon Musk's social media posts and news coverage. Users shared screenshots showing Grok searching Musk's X posts, such as for questions on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Researchers like Jeremy Howard and Simon Willison replicated this behavior, noting Grok's reliance on Musk's views even without custom instructions. The AI faced additional controversies, including antisemitic comments in automated replies, prompting xAI to limit accounts and update prompts. This raises questions about Grok's claim to be 'maximally truth-seeking'.

- Congressional Stock Trading Ban Proposed Amid High Public Support: A bipartisan bill has been introduced in the US Senate by Senators Kristen Gillibrand and Josh Hawley to ban stock trading and ownership for members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, and their families. The legislation aims to prevent conflicts of interest and has strong public support, with over 80% of voters across political parties favoring the ban according to a University of Maryland survey. Despite previous efforts to implement similar restrictions stalling in Congress, the current STOCK Act only requires disclosure of trades, which many consider insufficient. The bill would also apply to spouses and dependents, and some members of Congress argue a ban could deter candidates from running. Investment funds have been created to track and capitalize on politicians' trading habits. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/]
