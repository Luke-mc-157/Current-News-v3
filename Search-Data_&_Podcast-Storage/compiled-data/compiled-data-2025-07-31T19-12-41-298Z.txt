- Tesla's 'more affordable model' shown in spy shots on Chinese social media: Tesla's new 'more affordable model' is a decontented version of the Model Y, as revealed by spy shots circulating on Chinese social media. The images show modifications such as the removal of the panoramic glass roof, rear screen, and changes to the center console to reduce costs. Tesla had previously canceled its plans for a $25,000 Model 2 vehicle, shifting focus to these updated existing models. During a Q2 earnings call, Elon Musk confirmed that the affordable model is based on the Model Y. Potential additional cost savings may come from options like rear-wheel drive only or smaller batteries. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/]
