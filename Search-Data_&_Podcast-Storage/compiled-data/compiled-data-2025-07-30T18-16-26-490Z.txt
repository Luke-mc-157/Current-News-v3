- Pets, Like Dogs and Cats, Have an Environmental Cost. Here’s How to Lessen It.: Dogs and cats in the US consume a significant portion of animal-derived calories, contributing to about a quarter of agriculture-related fossil fuel emissions and land use. Pet waste, rich in nutrients, can cause soil contamination and water pollution, potentially leading to biodiversity loss in areas with high dog-walking activity. To reduce environmental impacts, experts recommend choosing pet foods with lower animal protein content, such as those made from chicken rather than beef, and opting for dry food over wet. Reducing overfeeding is advised, as many pets are overweight, which benefits both pet health and the environment. Keeping cats indoors and leashing dogs can prevent wildlife predation and disturbance. Adopting pets from shelters instead of buying from breeders helps address the issue of unwanted animals and lowers the overall environmental footprint.
