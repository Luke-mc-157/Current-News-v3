- Why Tesla Stock Plummeted 21.3% in the First Half of 2025 -- and What Comes Next: Tesla's stock price declined by 21.3% in the first half of 2025, contrasting with gains in the broader market. The drop was driven by lower vehicle deliveries, with Q1 deliveries at 336,681 units, a 13% year-over-year decrease, and Q2 deliveries at approximately 384,122 units, down 14% from the previous year. Political factors and competition from Chinese manufacturers contributed to the stock's pressure. Tesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in late June, but it has not yet stabilized the stock. The company's market valuation remains high at around 10.8 times this year's expected sales, relying on future growth from projects like robotaxis.
