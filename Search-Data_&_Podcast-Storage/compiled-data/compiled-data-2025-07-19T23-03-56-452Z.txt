- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India - The New York Times: Elon Musk's Starlink division cleared its final regulatory hurdle in India, allowing it to begin commercial operations after a three-year approval process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, enabling Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time. High import duties and taxes in India result in significantly higher prices for Tesla models, such as the Model Y starting at around $70,000 compared to $44,990 in the United States. Experts indicate that Starlink must comply with data localization requirements and may target semi-urban areas for rollout due to better market potential. The developments mark progress in Musk's efforts to expand in India despite ongoing regulatory challenges and a complicated relationship with the Indian government. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/world/asia/tesla-starlink-india-elon-musk.html]
Key Quotes: "symbolically important, commercially insignificant." - Eliot Pence, chief business officer of Osmo | "The Tesla’s high price, at least in the short run, could limit sales which in turn would likely limit the building out of the charging infrastructure the cars need." - Pravin Krishna, economist at Johns Hopkins University | "For example, Starlink will have to store the data it collects in India, so the Indian government will have access to it for national security reasons, and allow the Indian government and law enforcement agencies to suspend or shut down internet services when requested." - Varun Gupta, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research
