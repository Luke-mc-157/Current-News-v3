- China Is Spending Billions to Become an A.I. Superpower - The New York Times: China is investing heavily in artificial intelligence to compete with the United States, using state support for infrastructure, talent, and start-ups. The government has spent nearly $100 billion on semiconductors and allocated $8.5 billion for young AI companies. Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are developing open-source AI systems that rank among the world's best, despite US restrictions such as chip sales bans. This industrial policy approach has helped China advance in AI, though it faces inefficiencies like resource allocation challenges. Local governments are incentivizing AI development by creating start-up incubators and offering subsidies to attract talent and businesses. [https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/]
Key Quotes: "China is applying state support across the entire A.I. tech stack, from chips and data centers down to energy." - Kyle Chan, RAND Corporation | "For the government to help us cover even 13 or 15 percent of our early-stage research costs, that’s a huge benefit." - Jia Haojun, founder of Deep Principle | "Open-source is a source of technological soft power." - Kevin Xu, Interconnected Capital | "make sure democratic A.I. wins over authoritarian A.I." - Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive

- Generative A.I. Destroys a Building in Its Netflix Debut - The New York Times: Netflix used generative AI for the first time in the Argentine series 'The Eternaut' to create a scene of a building collapsing, which significantly reduced production time and costs. The technology allowed the scene to be completed 10 times faster than with traditional visual effects. Netflix executives view AI as a tool to enhance creativity in filmmaking, not just cut expenses, as stated during an earnings call. The use of AI in entertainment has raised concerns, leading to protections in actor contracts from the SAG-AFTRA strike to ensure compensation for digital replicas. Netflix is also exploring AI applications in areas like content personalization and recommendations to improve user experience. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/technology/china-ai.html]
