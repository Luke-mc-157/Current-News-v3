- Trump’s A.I. Challenge: Focus on Weapon Concerns or Woke-ism? - The New York Times: President Trump issued an executive order prioritizing the prevention of 'woke' AI in government systems, shifting focus from the Biden administration's concerns about AI enabling weapons of mass destruction. The order bars the use of AI models that contradict Trump's views, following incidents like Google's Gemini portraying diverse images of historical figures. Trump aims to boost AI dominance by expediting approvals for energy sources and data farms, framing the competition as a global race with China. The administration emphasizes economic and military benefits of AI leadership while acknowledging risks like cyberattacks and weapon development. Critics argue this approach could introduce bias and suppress diverse perspectives in AI technology. [https://www.reuters.com/]
Key Quotes: "The American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the A.I. models" - President Trump | "The government should not be acting as a ministry of A.I. truth or insisting that A.I. models hew to its preferred interpretation of reality" - Samir Jain, Center for Democracy and Technology | "Whoever has the largest A.I. ecosystem will set global A.I. standards and reap broad economic and military benefits" - Trump administration officials

- No ‘woke AI’ in Washington, says Trump, as he launches AI action plan: President Trump signed an executive order to prevent 'woke AI' in the federal government, prioritizing truth-seeking AI over ideological agendas like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The order mandates that AI models be neutral and accurate, avoiding biases in outputs, and references past examples of inaccurate AI representations. Additional orders aim to accelerate AI innovation by reducing regulations and establish a program for exporting American AI technology. The AI Action Plan includes 90 federal policy actions across innovation, infrastructure, and international leadership. Trump criticized DEI in AI for potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes and emphasized the need for objective AI development.

- [Updated RSS Feed] by tim.hodson (7/24/2025): "Eight Companies Selected to Drive Tech Improvements for AHA Heart and Brain Accelerator" - July 22, 2025 — In a collaboration between American Heart Association Ventures and the Association’s Center for Health Technology and Innovation, eight companies have been selected to participate in the American Heart Association Heart and Brain Health Accelerator. Through the Accelerator, the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, aims to drive innovation with the potential to enhance patient outcomes, lower costs and reduce barriers to care. This is one of many ways the Association is exploring cutting-edge technology solutions that are scalable, accessible and effective, ensuring that everyone, everywhere can live longer, healthier lives. “Innovation is essential to advancing health and improving outcomes for people affected by heart disease and stroke,” said Lisa Suennen, managing partner of American Heart Association Ventures. “Through the Heart and Brain Health Accelerator, we’re proud to support breakthrough technologies with the potential to transform care. By connecting these companies to mentorship, funding and our network of experts, we aim to accelerate their path from promising concept to lifesaving impact.” The Heart Association’s Heart and Brain Health Accelerator is one track within the larger MedTech Innovator Accelerator Program. The track is designed to identify and support companies with novel medical or digital health technologies aligned with the lifesaving mission of the American Heart Association. These eight finalists have specific solutions and applications identified by experts for their potential to positively impact women’s cardiovascular and brain health outcomes: Kelvin Health, a health care technology company that uses mobile thermal imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide quick, non-invasive diagnostics for vascular diseases. LightHearted AI Health, a health technology company that offers a contactless biometric device using laser light and AI to quickly and accurately detect heart conditions, aiming to make heart diagnostics more accessible and affordable. MOMM Diagnostics, a health-tech startup developing a rapid, highly sensitive blood test designed to detect preeclampsia early in pregnancy using a simple fingerstick sample and a compact reader, enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses during routine checkups. Powerful Medical, a health technology company that uses AI to help doctors quickly and accurately interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs), which are used to record the electrical activity of the heart. Reach Neuro, a medical technology company that has developed an implantable device delivering small electrical pulses to the spinal cord, helping stroke survivors regain control of their arm and hand movements, even years after their stroke, by enhancing communication between the brain and muscles. Sinaptica Therapeutics, a medical technology company developing a non-invasive, personalized brain stimulation therapy aimed at slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease by enhancing memory-related brain networks. SynchNeuro, a health technology company developing a non-invasive, behind-the-ear wearable device that uses brain signals to monitor blood sugar levels, aiming to help people with prediabetes manage their health without needles or implants. Veravas, a health technology company that has developed a patented platform using magnetic beads to purify and concentrate biomarkers from complex samples like blood or saliva, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of diseases such as Alzheimer's. The selected health tech companies now also become official members of the Medtech Innovator program for this year, which includes access to networking opportunities, funding and increased visibility within the medical technology industry. In addition, they will receive specialized mentorship, coaching and capacity building from American Heart Association Ventures, customized to their focus on cardiovascular and/or brain conditions and diseases. As participants in the Heart and Brain Health Accelerator, these companies qualify to participate in the MedTech Innovator Competition Finals, held at the MedTech Conference on Oct. 5-8, 2025, in San Diego. Astellas Rx+ sponsors the American Heart Association Heart and Brain Heath Accelerator track. The companies were selected by expert volunteers on an American Heart Association advisory committee.
