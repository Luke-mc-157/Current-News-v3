- KXAN Austin Weather: Approaching the end of the month with hotter temperatures: Central Texas had a quiet morning with sunshine and scattered clouds, featuring warm and humid conditions with lows in the low to mid-70s. Afternoon temperatures are expected to reach the mid-90s, with a low chance of isolated showers in counties east and southeast of Austin. A ridge of high pressure will move over the region, bringing hotter and drier weather with highs in the upper 90s to triple digits mid-week. Humidity will decrease as dew points fall, making conditions less muggy. Rain chances are forecasted to return later in the week, potentially increasing over the weekend due to an approaching weather disturbance. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/]

- KXAN Austin Weather: Extreme heat streaks becoming more numerous: An analysis by Climate Central indicates that Austin has seen an increase in extreme heat streaks, defined as three or more consecutive days with maximum temperatures in the top 10% historically. Data shows that 80% of 247 U.S. cities, including Austin, experienced more such streaks in recent decades compared to the 1970s, with Austin averaging an increase of at least two streaks per year. Between 2010 and 2019, Austin had five more heat streaks, though numbers decreased slightly in the early 2020s. These streaks can worsen air quality by promoting ground-level ozone formation and increase health risks due to higher chances of heat-related illnesses. In a warming climate, the frequency of these events may rise, straining power grids and highlighting negative impacts on daily life. [https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt]

- Alpha School, AI-Driven Education Founded in Austin, Is Coming to More Cities - The New York Times: Alpha School in Austin, Texas, uses artificial intelligence to lead academic sessions for just two hours a day, focusing on personalized learning for students from kindergarten to high school. Founded in 2014, the school currently serves about 250 students across two campuses and is expanding to over a dozen cities this fall. Critics, including Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers, argue that the AI-driven model may hinder social skills and critical thinking by reducing human interaction. Supporters, such as co-founder MacKenzie Price, claim it allows for tailored education and more time for practical skills like entrepreneurship and public speaking. Tuition at the Austin schools is $40,000 per year, with plans to open new schools in rented spaces starting with small student bodies. The school's approach has drawn both praise for innovation and skepticism regarding its effectiveness compared to traditional education.

- Austin Pedal Car: Welsh vehicle built by miners, fit for a king: Austin Pedal Cars were manufactured in Bargoed, Wales, from 1949 to 1971 by former miners suffering from respiratory diseases as part of a government rehabilitation scheme.

A blue plaque is being installed near the former factory site to commemorate the workers who also produced parts for real cars.

- Turbulence is increasing. Here's how the aviation industry is trying to smooth things out: Climate change is causing an increase in turbulence, with severe clear-air turbulence rising by 55% since 1979 according to meteorological records. Turbulence is expected to triple worldwide by the 2050s, potentially impacting flight routes over areas like East Asia and the North Atlantic. The aviation industry is developing solutions such as flaplets on aircraft wings to stabilize planes and AI systems for better prediction and mitigation of turbulence. Improved forecasting techniques have increased turbulence prediction accuracy from about 60% two decades ago to 75% today. Apps and real-time data sharing are being utilized to help pilots avoid turbulent areas, reducing risks and discomfort for passengers.

- 'Rs 29 lakh tax' on Tesla Model Y triggers online uproar, viral post says 'US pays 50% less' - Trending News | The Financial Express: Tesla launched the Model Y in India at approximately Rs 61 lakh, while in the US it is priced at about $37,490 after federal tax credits, highlighting a significant price disparity. The high cost in India is primarily due to import duties of 70-100% on fully assembled vehicles, leading to an additional tax burden of around Rs 29 lakh for buyers. A viral social media post by user Sumit Behal criticized this tax difference, sparking widespread online discussions and frustration among consumers. Users debated the implications for India's electric vehicle market, with some seeing it as an opportunity for local manufacturing and others pointing out the lack of benefits from high taxes. The article notes that Tesla currently imports vehicles rather than producing them locally, which contributes to the elevated prices.
