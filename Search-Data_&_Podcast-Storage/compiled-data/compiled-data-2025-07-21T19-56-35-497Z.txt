- There's Neuralink‚Äîand There's the Mind-Reading Company That Might Surpass It | WIRED: Synchron is developing a brain-computer interface as a less invasive alternative to Neuralink's technology, using a stent-like device implanted via blood vessels to avoid open-skull surgery. The Stentrode device has been tested in patients with ALS, enabling them to control computers and devices with their thoughts, as demonstrated by patient Mark Jackson who uses it for gaming and communication. Synchron's system integrates with consumer technologies like Apple Vision Pro and Amazon Alexa, and includes AI features from OpenAI to enhance functionality. The company is advancing toward a pivotal FDA trial for commercialization, aiming to provide independence for people with disabilities. Unlike Neuralink's more invasive method, Synchron's approach may reduce risks and allow for broader brain coverage with multiple implants.
