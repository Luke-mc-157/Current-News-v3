The owner reported a battery replacement that reduced vehicle range and criticized CEO Elon Musk's behavior. Reddit users commented on the situation, with some questioning the validity of Tesla's upgrade promises and suggesting traditional cars as alternatives. The article also highlighted broader Tesla issues, including recalls of Cybertrucks and poor customer service responses. This case reflects ongoing concerns about Tesla's product longevity and customer satisfaction. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/]

- Tesla, EV buyers need to act now if they want $7,500 tax credit: The federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used ones is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2025, prompting urgency for buyers to act. Tesla and other EV manufacturers may see price increases and potential sales declines without the credit. Analysts predict a surge in EV purchases before the deadline and a subsequent drop, with leasing offering a way to still access the credit. The credit's end could slow EV adoption due to higher costs and other barriers like range anxiety. Despite this, some experts suggest that improving EV technology and lower operating costs may sustain demand in the long term.
