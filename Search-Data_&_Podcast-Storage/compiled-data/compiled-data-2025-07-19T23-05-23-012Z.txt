- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India: Elon Musk's Starlink received final regulatory approval in India to begin commercial satellite broadband operations after a three-year process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, allowing Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time. High import duties and taxes in India make Tesla cars expensive, with the Model Y starting at around $70,000 compared to $44,990 in the US. Experts noted that Starlink may focus on semi-urban areas for better market penetration due to rural challenges, and Tesla faces potential sales limitations from premium pricing. The developments highlight Musk's ongoing efforts to expand in India despite a complicated relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

- China Is Spending Billions to Become an A.I. Superpower: China is investing billions of dollars in artificial intelligence to close the gap with the United States, using state-backed industrial policies similar to those in electric vehicles and solar power.
