- U.S. Proposes Steep Tariffs on Critical E.V. Battery Material - The New York Times: The U.S. Commerce Department announced a preliminary ruling to impose a 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite due to alleged dumping practices. Graphite is a critical component in electric vehicle batteries, with China supplying nearly all refined graphite used by companies like Tesla. This tariff will increase costs for automakers such as Ford and battery suppliers like Panasonic, potentially raising electric vehicle prices. The decision coincides with the upcoming end of federal EV tax credits in the U.S., adding further pressure on the industry. Tesla objected to the tariff petition, stating that U.S. suppliers lack the technical ability to produce sufficient battery-grade graphite. The ruling is preliminary, with a final decision expected in December. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/business/trump-graphite-tariff-electric-vehicles.html]

- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India - The New York Times: Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary, received final regulatory approval to begin commercial operations in India after a three-year process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, enabling Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time. Despite high import duties and luxury taxes, this marks progress in Elon Musk's efforts to enter the Indian market. Experts noted that Starlink may focus on semi-urban areas for rollout due to better consumer potential, while facing requirements like data localization for national security. Tesla's high vehicle prices, starting at around $70,000 in India compared to $44,990 in the U.S., could limit sales and infrastructure development. The developments highlight Musk's complicated relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid ongoing business discussions.
