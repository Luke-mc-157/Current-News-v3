- Elon Musk’s Twitter sues New York over social media law; says against First Amendment: X, formerly Twitter, has filed a lawsuit against New York challenging a law that requires social media platforms to maintain clearer content moderation policies and disclose how they handle misinformation, hate speech, and extremism. The suit argues that the law violates First Amendment rights by compelling platforms to adopt specific viewpoints and interfering with editorial discretion. X contends that the legislation forces private companies to explain moderation decisions to users, which they claim is an unconstitutional mandate. The case is filed in Manhattan federal court, targeting New York's Stop Hiding Hate Act, and draws parallels to a similar blocked law in California.
