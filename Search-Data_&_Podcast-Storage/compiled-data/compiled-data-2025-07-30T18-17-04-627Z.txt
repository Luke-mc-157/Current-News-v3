Aims to Kill a Bedrock Scientific Finding: The EPA proposed to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare.

Environmental groups and experts noted that transportation is a major source of U.S. emissions, and repealing the finding could hinder future climate efforts.
