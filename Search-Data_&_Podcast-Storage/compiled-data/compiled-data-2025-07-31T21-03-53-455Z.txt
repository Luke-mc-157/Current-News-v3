Oceanographers explained that while the tsunami caused minor flooding, it did not lead to mass devastation but still posed risks if people did not evacuate. Updates included wave heights in various regions and advisories for Hawaii and Japan, with experts discussing why damage was limited. The reporting also provided historical context and real-time developments on natural disaster responses. [https://cbsnews.com/tag/tsunami]
Key Quotes: "The threat of a major tsunami hitting the United States 'has passed completely.'" - U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem | "It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground." - Simon Boxall, oceanography professor at the University of Southampton
