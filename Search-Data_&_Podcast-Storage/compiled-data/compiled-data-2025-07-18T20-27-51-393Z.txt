- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India: Elon Musk's Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary, has received final regulatory approval in India to begin commercial operations after a three-year process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, allowing Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time. High import duties and taxes in India make Tesla cars significantly more expensive, with the Model Y starting at around $70,000 compared to $44,990 in the United States. Experts indicate that these costs could limit sales and hinder the development of necessary charging infrastructure. Starlink may target semi-urban areas for rollout due to better market potential, supported by partnerships with Indian telecom companies like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.

- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India: Starlink, Elon Musk's satellite broadband venture under SpaceX, received final regulatory approval in India after a three-year process, allowing it to begin commercial operations. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, enabling Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time.
