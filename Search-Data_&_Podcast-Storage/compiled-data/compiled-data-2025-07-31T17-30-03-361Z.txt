- Treasury Secretary Says Trump Accounts Could Pave Way to Privatizing Social Security - The New York Times: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Trump accounts for children could serve as a pathway to privatizing Social Security by shifting reliance to financial markets. These accounts provide a $1,000 government contribution at birth and allow investments in stock funds, with additional contributions possible from parents and employers. Bessent later clarified that the accounts are intended to supplement, not replace, Social Security benefits amid concerns over the program's funding shortfall. Social Security faces potential automatic benefit cuts by 2033 due to rising costs outpacing payroll tax revenue. Democrats criticized the comments as an attempt to undermine the program, drawing parallels to a failed privatization effort under President George W. Bush. The accounts are projected to cost the federal government $15 billion over a decade. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/business/bessent-trump-social-security.html]
