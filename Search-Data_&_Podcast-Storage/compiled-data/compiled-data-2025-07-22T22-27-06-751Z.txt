- Elon Musk just made his starkest political threat since the election | CNN Business: Elon Musk threatened to support primary challenges against members of Congress who voted for a massive debt increase, despite campaigning on reducing spending. He proposed forming a new political party called the America Party if the spending bill passes, criticizing the current system as a 'uniparty'. President Donald Trump responded by accusing Musk of relying heavily on subsidies and suggesting a review by the Department of Government Efficiency.

Musk's opposition contrasts with his previous financial support for Trump in the 2024 election, focusing on fiscal policy disagreements. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/]
