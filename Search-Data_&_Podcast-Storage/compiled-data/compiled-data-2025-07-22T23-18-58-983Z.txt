- A.I. vs. A.I.: Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in cybercrime to create deepfakes, phishing scams, and disinformation campaigns, making attacks more scalable and harder to detect. Cybersecurity companies employ AI to intercept malicious traffic, patch vulnerabilities, and automate defenses, improving speed and accuracy over manual methods. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, phishing attacks have surged more than fortyfold, and deepfakes have increased over twentyfold. Experts note that while AI enhances the efficiency of both offensive and defensive operations, it also introduces risks such as errors in defensive systems that could block legitimate traffic. AI's role in cyber activities is expected to grow, with cybercrime costs projected to exceed $23 trillion annually by 2027. The article highlights a shift in the cyber landscape where AI accelerates the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/briefing/ai-vs-ai.html]
