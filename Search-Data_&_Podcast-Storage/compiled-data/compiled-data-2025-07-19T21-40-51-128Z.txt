- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India: Elon Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX, achieved key milestones in India with Starlink clearing its final regulatory hurdle for commercial operations after a three-year process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, allowing Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time. Experts highlighted challenges such as high import duties making Tesla cars expensive, with the Model Y starting at around $70,000 in India compared to $44,990 in the US. Starlink must comply with data localization rules and may target semi-urban areas for rollout due to growing remote work demands. Partnerships with Indian telecom firms like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel were formed to facilitate service deployment. The developments signify progress in Musk's long-term efforts to enter the Indian market despite ongoing regulatory and governmental complexities.

- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India: Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary, cleared its final regulatory hurdle in India after a three-year process, allowing it to begin commercial operations. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, enabling Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles for the first time. High import duties and taxes in India make Tesla vehicles expensive, with the Model Y starting at around $70,000 compared to less than $25,000 for other electric vehicles. Starlink must comply with data localization requirements, storing data in India for national security access. Experts suggest Starlink may target semi-urban areas for rollout due to growing remote work needs, while rural areas could pose market challenges.

That‚Äôs not how Musk works: Tesla is facing significant challenges, including declining sales, profits, and stock value, partly attributed to Elon Musk's divided attention across various ventures.

The Tesla board is urged to impose constraints on Musk's activities to prioritize company operations. Experts warn that Musk's polarizing public image is damaging Tesla's brand and ability to attract talent. [https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/14/business/elon-musk-tesla-full-time-ceo]
