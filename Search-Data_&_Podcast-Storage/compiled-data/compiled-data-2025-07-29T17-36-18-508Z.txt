- Starmer Is Edging Closer to Recognizing a Palestinian State, UK Officials Say: Britain is actively considering recognizing a Palestinian state due to public pressure over starvation in Gaza, with two senior government officials indicating a shift in position. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has historically resisted such recognition, viewing it as performative and potentially complicating ceasefire negotiations. The change is driven by the escalating humanitarian crisis, including reports of deaths from starvation amid Israeli aid restrictions. Starmer discussed the issue with President Trump, who did not discourage the move and emphasized feeding people in Gaza. Critics, including former British ambassador Kim Darroch, argue that recognition raises legal questions and may not improve conditions on the ground. The UK aims to support a two-state solution through this potential recognition as part of broader peace efforts.

Key Quotes: "What he says doesn‚Äôt matter; I like him, but that statement doesn‚Äôt carry weight." - Donald Trump | "I‚Äôm not going to take a position; I don‚Äôt mind him taking a position." - Donald Trump | "It‚Äôs a political decision but it involves a whole range of legal criteria." - Kim Darroch

- UK will recognise Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to Gaza ceasefire and other conditions: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that Britain will recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September unless Israel takes substantive steps to address the Gaza crisis. Conditions include agreeing to a ceasefire, committing to a long-term peace process, and avoiding annexation in the West Bank. Israel rejected the statement, accusing the UK of rewarding Hamas and undermining ceasefire efforts. The decision is influenced by the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with reports of famine and high casualties, and pressure from over 200 MPs across parties. Starmer emphasized that there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas, demanding the release of hostages and Hamas's disarmament. This move aligns with actions by other countries like France, which plans similar recognition. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/world/europe/uk-starmer-palestinian-state.html]
Key Quotes: "Israel rejects the statement by the prime minister of the United Kingdom." - Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs | "The shift in the British government‚Äôs position at this time... constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages." - Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs

- UK to recognize Palestinian state in September: The UK is planning to recognize a Palestinian state in September, as reported in a brief update.
