- Facebook, social media are major players in US politics | Opinion: Social media platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) significantly influence political attitudes and participation by shaping how users consume and perceive information. A study co-authored by Kevin Wagner found that Facebook users tend to have less positive views of democracy due to its bottom-up structure amplifying dissent and frustration. In contrast, X users reported more favorable attitudes, often driven by elite voices that promote institutional narratives. The research analyzed data from 18 countries, highlighting how these platforms can foster cynicism or engagement in politics. The author argues that social media acts as an active player in the political process, raising concerns about its impact on democracy in the US and beyond. [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/]
