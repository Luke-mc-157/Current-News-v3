- Tesla shareholders want a full-time CEO. That’s not how Musk works | CNN Business: Tesla is facing significant challenges in 2025, including the largest drops in sales and profits in its history, attributed partly to Elon Musk's divided attention on external activities. Shareholders and analysts are calling for Musk to dedicate more time to Tesla, with concerns that his political engagements and focus on projects like robotaxis are harming the company's core electric vehicle business. The Tesla board has not imposed restrictions on Musk, despite warnings that his absence is unusual for a company of its size. Musk's responses to criticism, such as telling analyst Dan Ives to 'shut up,' highlight tensions, while experts question whether he remains the right leader for Tesla's future amid declining stock value and regulatory changes impacting revenue.

- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India - The New York Times: Elon Musk's companies achieved key milestones in India, with Starlink receiving final regulatory approval to operate commercially after a three-year process. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, marking the initial step for Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles. Despite these advancements, high import duties in India make Tesla cars expensive, starting at around $70,000 compared to $44,990 in the US. Experts suggest Starlink may target semi-urban areas for rollout due to better market potential, while challenges like data localization and infrastructure development remain. Musk's efforts to enter India have been longstanding, amid a complex relationship with the Indian government involving business and regulatory issues. [https://www.npr.org/sections/national/]
