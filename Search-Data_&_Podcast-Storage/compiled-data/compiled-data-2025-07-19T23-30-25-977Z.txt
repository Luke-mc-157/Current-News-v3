- Musk Clears Final Hurdles for Tesla and Starlink in India - The New York Times: Elon Musk's Starlink received final regulatory approval in India after a three-year process, allowing it to begin commercial operations and potentially serve millions without internet access. Tesla opened its first showroom in Mumbai, enabling Indian consumers to purchase electric vehicles directly. High import duties and taxes make Tesla cars expensive, with the Model Y starting at around $70,000 in India compared to $44,990 in the US. Analysts suggest Starlink may target semi-urban areas for better market penetration due to rural challenges, and partnerships with Indian telecom giants like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are in place. Despite these advancements, regulatory and economic hurdles remain, including data localization requirements and potential delays in infrastructure development.
