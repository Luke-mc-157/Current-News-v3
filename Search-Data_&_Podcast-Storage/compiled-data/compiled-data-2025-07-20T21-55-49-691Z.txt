SUPPORTING ARTICLES (7):
- A furious Chinese internet takes on privilege: Viral scandals in China have targeted individuals accused of using family connections for unfair advantages, including actresses, a Harvard graduate, and a doctor. Public outrage on social media platforms like Weibo has led to official investigations by authorities, reflecting frustration with inequality amid economic slowdown. For example, actress Nashi was scrutinized over her exam scores and removed from projects, while a doctor had her medical license revoked for alleged cheating. These incidents highlight how social media serves as an outlet for discontent in a censored society, with users expressing disillusionment over systemic unfairness. Research shows that perceptions of 'guanxi' or connections outweighing hard work are fueling the backlash. Authorities have responded with investigations, but public trust remains eroded.

Key Quotes: "There‚Äôs privilege every year, but this year there‚Äôs more than ever." - Weibo user | "I would love to see more scandals like this. They are truly eye-opening." - Weibo user | "You know what you know." - Weibo user

- Members only: Inside the new playgrounds of India's rich and famous: A new generation of wealth creators in India is driving demand for modern private members-only clubs, contrasting with traditional colonial-era establishments. International chains like Soho House are expanding, offering spaces for networking, relaxation, and events tailored to entrepreneurs and creatives in a tech-driven economy. Membership is based on personal achievement rather than family legacy, with high costs making it exclusive. The growth is fueled by India's rising number of high-net-worth individuals, expected to double soon, amid broader economic inequalities. COVID-19 accelerated the trend by pushing the wealthy to avoid public spaces. This reflects India's post-liberalization shift, where luxury markets boom despite challenges for the average population. [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7827pwlro]
Key Quotes: "There‚Äôs growth in India‚Äôs young wealth, and young entrepreneurs really need a foundation to platform themselves." - Kelly Wardingham, Soho House‚Äôs Asia regional director

- Andy Byron: US tech CEO resigns after Coldplay concert embrace goes viral: Andy Byron, CEO of tech company Astronomer, resigned after a viral video showed him embracing a female co-worker at a Coldplay concert, prompting an internal investigation. The company stated that Byron did not meet expected standards of conduct and accountability, leading to his immediate departure. During the concert, Coldplay's Chris Martin commented on the incident humorously to the audience. Astronomer placed Byron on leave shortly after the video gained millions of views and later accepted his resignation. The event underscores issues of professional ethics in the tech industry. No further details on the nature of the relationship were disclosed by the company. [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nwp9z39lo]
Key Quotes: "Either they‚Äôre having an affair, or they‚Äôre just very shy." - Chris Martin, Coldplay lead singer | "Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met." - Astronomer company statement
