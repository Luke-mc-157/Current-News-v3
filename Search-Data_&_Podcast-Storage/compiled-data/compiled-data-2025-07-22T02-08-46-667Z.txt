- What to Know About the Fallout Around the Epstein Files and the Trump Administration: The Trump administration faced backlash for not releasing full Jeffrey Epstein files, despite promises, fueling conspiracy theories among supporters. Epstein was a convicted sex offender with ties to figures like Trump and Bill Clinton, and his case involved sex trafficking charges. The administration partially relented by seeking to unseal grand jury testimony, but FBI files often contain a mix of intelligence and speculation. Trump's relationship with Epstein is documented through past associations, but no incriminating evidence has been confirmed. The case highlights ongoing public interest in transparency regarding Epstein's connections. [https://www.nytimes.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-files-trump.html]

The base's frustration temporarily subsided, but some conservatives remained skeptical about transparency.
