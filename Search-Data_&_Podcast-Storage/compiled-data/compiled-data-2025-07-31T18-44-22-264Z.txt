- Proliferating 'news' sites spew AI-generated fake stories: Researchers have identified hundreds of AI-powered websites that generate fake news stories using generative AI tools, making it easier and cheaper to produce misleading content. A specific example is a fabricated story about the Israeli prime minister's psychiatrist committing suicide, which spread widely across social media and was rewritten from a satirical source. NewsGuard analysis revealed that sites like Global Village Space use AI to scrape and repurpose content, potentially deceiving users into perceiving them as trustworthy. Experts warn that this trend could significantly influence elections and erode public trust in media, with AI enabling the rapid dissemination of propaganda. The article also notes that programmatic advertising may inadvertently support these sites, and researchers emphasize the need to address the blurring line between reality and fiction.

- Extreme weather misinfo 'putting lives at risk': A report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) warns that social media platforms amplify misinformation about extreme weather events, endangering lives and disrupting emergency responses. The study analyzed viral posts during disasters like the Texas floods, finding that conspiracy theories often overshadow accurate information. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube frequently fail to fact-check or label misleading content, with examples including false claims during LA wildfires gaining more views than official sources. This misinformation is driven by business models that profit from outrage, according to the report. CCDH calls for improved moderation to mitigate risks during climate disasters and protect vulnerable populations. [https://www.bbc.com/news]
Key Quotes: "The influence of high-profile conspiracy theorists during climate disasters is drowning out emergency response efforts." - Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) report | "The rapid spread of climate conspiracies online isn’t accidental. It’s baked into a business model that profits from outrage and division." - Imran Ahmed, CCDH chief executive | "When distraught people can’t distinguish real help from online deception, platforms become complicit in the suffering of innocent people." - Imran Ahmed, CCDH chief executive
