- What are tariffs, how do they work and why is Trump using them?: Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, typically as a percentage of the product's value, which increases costs for importers and may be passed on to consumers. President Trump has used tariffs to boost American manufacturing, reduce the trade deficit, and pressure trade partners into favorable deals. Specific tariffs include 50% on steel and aluminum, and varying rates on imports from countries like China, Mexico, and Canada, with some exemptions and delays. These measures have caused volatility in global markets, higher prices for US consumers, and downgraded economic growth forecasts by organizations like the IMF and OECD. Critics argue the policies disrupt international trade, while Trump claims they protect US jobs and interests. [https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/]

Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva condemned the measures as an infringement on sovereignty and democracy, hinting at possible retaliatory tariffs. Many Brazilian exports, such as commercial aircraft and orange juice, are exempt from the tariffs, with the levies set to take effect soon. The sanctions were issued under the Global Magnitsky Act, freezing any US assets of the justice and prohibiting certain transactions.
