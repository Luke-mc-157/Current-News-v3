Key Quotes: ""Darwin Nunez is a big guy, he’s powerful, quite pacey. He’s got all the attributes you need. The problem he’s had in England is that he can’t put the ball in the net and that’s what he was bought for. So whoever takes him, there is a striker in there, don’t worry, there is. He could go on to score loads and everyone will say we always thought this would happen eventually wherever he’s going to go. Unfortunately, he hasn’t done it in Liverpool this year. I think Andy Carroll many years ago went to Liverpool for a lot of money and didn’t perform, but yet went on to West Ham and did well. For Nunez, if he wants to go to Tottenham or somewhere like that, he does need to get away from Liverpool."" - Chris Waddle | ""I'm very happy to be here in Munich at this great club. My first impressions have been very good. I haven’t had much time yet, but I’ve been given a very warm welcome and I’m really looking forward to getting to know everyone better. I’ve decided to join Bayern because it’s a club that fits with my goals. My expectations are very big, so I wanted to join a big, ambitious club. We want to win everything here and I want to help the team. I spoke to Florian a few times and he told me that the Bundesliga is very intense, similar to the Premier League, that it was very physical, the stadiums are always full. He also told me that Munich is a very nice city and that I’d enjoy it. He wished me luck. I thank him for that."" - Luis Diaz
