- Proliferating 'news' sites spew AI-generated fake stories: Researchers warn that numerous AI-powered websites are imitating legitimate news sources and disseminating fabricated stories, such as a baseless claim about the Israeli prime minister's psychiatrist.

Experts highlight how this content, including propaganda on conflicts like Ukraine, may inadvertently gain support through advertising revenue and calls for measures to distinguish reality from fiction.
