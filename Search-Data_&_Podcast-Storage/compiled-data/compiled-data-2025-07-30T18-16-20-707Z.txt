- In Game-Changing Climate Rollback, E.P.A. Aims to Kill a Bedrock Scientific Finding - The New York Times: The EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, proposed revoking the 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health, which serves as the foundation for federal climate regulations. This action would eliminate the legal authority to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources under the Clean Air Act. The proposal is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to deregulate and denies the scientific consensus on climate change, citing a report from scientists skeptical of human-caused warming. Critics, including environmental groups, argue that the move ignores overwhelming evidence and prioritizes fossil fuel interests over public welfare. Legal challenges are expected, with a public comment period planned before finalization. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/climate/epa-endangerment-finding-repeal-proposal.html]
