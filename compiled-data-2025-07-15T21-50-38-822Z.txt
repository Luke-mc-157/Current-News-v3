- What to Know About the Fallout Around the Epstein Files and the Trump Administration - The New York Times: The Trump administration faced backlash after reversing its promise to release Jeffrey Epstein files, including a purported client list that many doubt exists. Elon Musk and other Trump supporters alleged cover-ups, leading to internal conflicts within the MAGA movement. Epstein was a convicted sex offender who paid teenage girls for sex acts and received a lenient plea deal in 2008. His 2019 arrest on sex-trafficking charges ended with his death in custody, fueling conspiracy theories. A Justice Department memo stated the files did not justify further investigations into others.

This unrest tests Trump's influence over his loyal followers who expected full disclosure. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/briefing/maga-bondi-epstein-files.html]
Key Quotes: "“People are really upset at the outright dismissal of it.”" - Natalie Winters | "“Trump’s persuasive power over his base, especially during his first term, was almost magical. … The reaction on Epstein should thus be startling to him.”" - Mike Cernovich

- Supreme court clears way for Trump to gut education department – as it happened | Trump administration | The Guardian: The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education by lifting a federal judge's order that had reinstated 1,400 laid-off employees.

Trump also announced plans to impose severe tariffs on Russia if no Ukraine peace deal is reached within 50 days. Additionally, a coalition of states sued the administration over withheld education funding, and updates included support for Ukraine with Patriot missiles.
